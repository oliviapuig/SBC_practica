    "review_text": "Mind blowingly cool. Best science fiction I've read in some time. I just loved all the descriptions of the society of the future - how they lived in trees, the notion of owning property or even getting married was gone. How every surface was a screen. \n The undulations of how society responds to the Trisolaran threat seem surprising to me. Maybe its more the Chinese perspective, but I wouldn't have thought the ETO would exist in book 1, and I wouldn't have thought people would get so over-confident in our primitive fleet's chances given you have to think that with superior science they would have weapons - and defenses - that would just be as rifles to arrows once were. \n But the moment when Luo Ji won as a wallfacer was just too cool. I may have actually done a fist pump. Though by the way, if the Dark Forest theory is right - and I see no reason why it wouldn't be - we as a society should probably stop broadcasting so much signal out into the universe.",

    "review_text": "This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \n I loved this quote: \n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\"",

Fast paced and good mystery. \n One that struck me was how similar Poirot is to Sherlock. They are both detectives, have a ex-military sidekick who is telling the story, and solve mysteries using their superior wit. Poirot seems like a French Sherlock. I'm curious if he was inspired by Sherlock.",

    "review_text": "Fun, fast paced, and disturbing tale of murder. Great beach read while in France, which is where its set. \n I enjoyed learning more about perfume and the power of scent - hearing the descriptions of how different kinds of scents are captured (distilled, oils, etc) was very interesting. I think in general we (certainly I) don't pay much attention to the power that scent holds over us in different situations. I will pay more attention now after reading this. Though I wish I had a stronger nose - curious if there are ways to cultivate that. My wife and I once bought a game at a wine store that had 30 different materials that they use in wine and you had to guess what they were. I think I got 3 out of 30 right :( \n This was a dark and twisted book though be forewarned - I generally don't like reading first person accounts of murderers - but in this case it was gripping. And the climax (yes that was a pun) was so ridiculous and fun that it was worth it.",

    "review_text": "Giving a high rating because I heard the organizer of the Long Now Foundation speak and it was very inspiring. The Interval Cafe in San Francisco is also awesome and has The Long Library in it. \n The part of the story that I liked most was the power of long thinking. How Oxford College has some gorgeous oak tree beams in their dining room, and they were crumbling, and so they wondered how to replace them. They created a search, and happened to ask the Oxford groundskeeper if any of the oak trees on campus would work, and he said yes, they should use the grove that was planted 500 years ago for that very purpose. So they did, and then planted another grove for 500 years from now. That's the power of long term thinking - how many of us are able to think that far ahead? That story is what inspired the clock, which is getting closer to completion and sounds pretty cool. \n The book was published in 1999 so I found a bunch of the ideas dated and found myself skimming through them, so only partially read this.",

    "review_text": "I decided to give up eating processed sugar for the month of January, and so reading a book with this title seemed like it would help me adhere. And not only did it succeed in that goal, but I think it put a permanent, deep scare in me about sugar. The book basically argues that sugar is the root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even a lot of cancer. \n What is interesting is while all of us know that sugar is not good for us, the only thing that people officially blame on overconsumption of it is tooth decay. Obesity is highly correlated with diabetes, heart disease, and a number of other bad things. If you Google for the cause of obesity, you see statements like \"Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don't burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.\" This book makes the argument that a calorie is not a calorie, that sugar is actually toxic, but unlike other toxins it takes decades of overconsumption to show up - which has made it hard to prove. \n The statistics are fascinating. Fifty years ago, one in eight American adults was obese; today the number is greater than one in three. Diabetes has gone from 1 in 2,000-3,000 to 1 in 7-8, which is an astounding increase. The book listed numerous examples of native populations that suffered from a similar diabetes epidemic after adopting the \"western diets and lifestyle\". What is it about western lifestyle that has done this? The culprit is almost certainly something in the diet, and linked to processed foods - and after reading this book, it seems very logical that sugar is either the root or one of the main root causes. \n \"By the late 1970s, though, sugar had mostly vanished from the discussion. Dietary fat had been implicated as a cause of heart disease. Nutritionists and public-health authorities responded by rejecting the idea that sugar could be responsible for the diseases that associated with heart disease, which included both obesity and diabetes.\" \n The book gives a fascinating history of how nutritionists and the government have viewed sugar as largely harmless. This included an impressive amount of lobbying from the sugar industry to vindicate themselves. Mind-blowingly, the sugar industry back in the 50's actually advertised sugar as a great, healthy way to get calories. Sugar has never, and largely is still not thought of as a root cause of obesity - the narrative is still more about fats and \"lifestyle\" (i.e. lack of exercise). \n \"To the sugar industry, it has been the gift that keeps on giving, the ultimate defense against all arguments and evidence that sugar is uniquely toxic. This is the idea that we get obese or overweight because we take in more calories than we expend or excrete. By this thinking, researchers and public-health authorities think of obesity as a disorder of \"energy balance,\" a concept that has become so ingrained in conventional thinking, so widespread, that arguments to the contrary have typically been treated as quackery, if not a willful disavowal of the laws of physics.\" \n \"Fat\" is often the culprit named for people getting fat (even the word is the same!), and thus was born a processed food industry that touts \"low-fat\" items (which are then rich in sugar+salt to offset the bad taste). But looking at populations that eat high fat content but low sugar, shows lower rates of obesity and heart disease. For instance, the French. \n \"When researchers realized that the French had relatively low rates of heart disease despite a diet that was rich in saturated fats, they wrote it off as an inexplicable \"paradox,\" and ignored the fact that the French traditionally consumed far less sugar than did populations-- the Americans and British, most notably-- in which coronary disease seemed to be a scourge. At the end of the eighteenth century, French per capita sugar consumption was less than a fifth of what it was in England. At the end of the nineteenth century, even after the beet-sugar revolution, France was still lagging far behind both the British and the Americans-- thirty-three pounds for the French compared with eighty-eight for the English and sixty-six for Americans.\" \n Interestingly, when we say \"sugar\" we can actually be referring to a number of things: fructose, glucose, or sucrose. Glucose is used to refer to blood sugar levels in blood, and also comes from eating carb rich foods like bread or potatoes. Sucrose is table sugar, which actually made of part fructose. Fructose is the scary one because \"it is very different from other sugars because it has a different metabolic pathway and is not the preferred energy source for muscles or the brain.\". Fructose is found in fruit but as such low levels that it isn't harmful, plus its offset by rich fibers. But high fructose corn syrup? Avoid at all costs. \n The logic is basically: IF excess sugar (fructose notably) leads to insulin resistance, THEN we can say with confidence that it is likely a root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer, as it's been proven to be correlated with all those things. High fat diets - particularly the wrong sorts of fats - are also involved if eaten in excess. The logic seems solid - and yet even searching \"what causes obesity\" you don't see sugar named as a key cause. I'd be very curious to learn from nutritionists what the think of this logic. \n \"Is it that we're all simply eating too much and exercising too little, which is the one simple answer that the nutritional establishment will embrace in the face of so much evidence to the contrary? Another simple answer, and a more likely one, is sugar.\"",

    "review_text": "I haven't read a non-fiction book this engaging in some time. This was an amazingly well written autobiography. It read like a fast paced novel through much of it. Many autobiographies are too long - this one if anything is too short! Like many startup companies, the story of Nike (or Blue Ribbon Shoes as it was initially called) is one of trials, tribulations, and lots of passion and grit. I ate it up, and highly recommend it. \n The most defining moment of the story is Knights ballsy move while backpacking through Japan at the age of 24, to walk into a Japanese shoe manufacturer and say he has a shoe distribution company, and get a exclusive deal for the western US. Gutsy. He \"just did it\" (sorry, but apt). I love learning examples of this kind of \"Do things that don't scale\" start to successful companies (eg Zappos, Amazon, many more). From there the story is one of doubling sales each year, and never quite having enough money on the balance sheet to make it anything but very risky. It was interesting - no fascinating - that Phil had an accounting background, and was well versed that the reason most startups fail is a lack of cash reserves, and yet he had so much faith in his growth and sales that he kept plowing all cash into growth. I loved reading the stories of how they barely made it from one order to the next, how twice they had to switch banks after being cut off. \n One of the key strategies of Nike's success today is athlete endorsement, and it was interesting to see how that strategy was formed in the early years. How they would offer large sums of money to athletes to wear their shoes - often to athletes already wearing their shoes - double down on people who already like your product. It was doubly interesting that Phil didn't initially believe in the power of advertising - I'd be very curious to hear how his opinion on that changed over time. \n The story of Prefontaine was a touching one, and one that stayed with me. I wasn't as familiar of the story of Pre, but had heard of him. But I didn't know the role that Nike sponsored him, and even employed him. Reading Phil talk about him, you got a sense of the passion his has for the sport of running. You got a sense that the story of Pre - his passion and drive - is a metaphor for how Nike was built. This quote says it better: \n \"For eleven laps they ran a half stride apart. With the crowd now roaring, frothing, shrieking, the two men entered the final lap. It felt like a boxing match. It felt like a joust. It felt like a bullfight, and we were down to that moment of truth--death hanging in the air. Pre reached down, found another level--we saw him do it. He opened up a yard lead, then two, then five. We saw Young grimacing and we knew that he could not, would not, catch Pre. I told myself, Don't forget this. Do not forget. I told myself there was much to be learned from such a display of passion, whether you were running a mile or a company.\" \n The book is a fascinating telling of the founding and early history of Nike. But it stops at the IPO, and then gives a chapter postlude. This is my only complaint. It was so well written - keep going! Tell us the story of Just Do It, Air Jordans, and so many more. I could read 4 more volumes of this, as it feels like there is so much more to they story of Nike to learn.",

    "review_text": "Kevin Kelly, who is a Wired co-founder, lays out technological trends that are \"inevitable\". Like too many nonfiction books, I found a few chapters to be worth reading, and a few not to be. I enjoyed the sections on AI and books. And sometimes just zooming out to get bigger perspective is engaging, which was the case for me in the sections on VR/AR and tracking. Much of the rest of the book seemed geared for people less technically savvy, which was my only complaint as it really drew the book out. \n There is a famous saying in software said by Marc Andreeson that \"software is eating the world\". Kelly predicts, I believe correctly, that the next phase of this will be AI: \"It is hard to imagine anything that would \"change everything\" as much as cheap, powerful, ubiquitous artificial\". Kelly's perspective here that while it might feel like innovation in technology is slowing to some, it is much more likely that we are on the brink of the next renaissance, and we will all be \"taking X and adding AI\", much as happened with electricity and then the internet. \n Kelly correctly identified the three key trends that are making AI an exciting space today: processing power (GPU's), data, and better algorithms. However he didn't dive more into the longest pole: how to get a lot more data than we have today - that seems to me to be the key. But cool to get an overview. He did address one of the big fears about automation that many people have today: will computers take all our jobs? The quick answer is yes, but we'll have new ones. This has already happened multiple times in history. I agree with this, but think the more interesting question is what will happen when we can provide most people the basics (food, water, shelter) for very little cost. This was predicted in Diamond Age, and the answer was \"parking lots and chaos\", and a lot of people with no purpose in life. \n I also greatly enjoyed the section on books, mostly because (1) Goodreads is mentioned (hey I have paternal pride), and (2) it talks about things we at Goodreads are working on. Such as, the ability to see other peoples notes: \"Reading becomes social. With screens we can share not just the titles of books we are reading, but our reactions and notes as we read them. Today, we can highlight a passage. Tomorrow, we will be able to link passages.\" Well, here are my notes from this book! \n Another big idea that Kelly hits on that I think is big and inevitable is how each book will become networked, much as the WWW has. Once we have ability to have pointers into and out from each sentence of a book, the speed at which ideas will fly out of books will step function. \n In the goodness of time, as all books become fully digital, every one of them will accumulate the equivalent of blue underlined passages as each literary reference is networked within that book out to all other books. Each page in a book will discover other pages and other books. Thus books will seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together into one large metabook, the universal library. The resulting collective intelligence of this synaptically connected library allows us to see things we can't see in a single isolated book.",

    "review_text": "Best book of the series, and best book about American history that I think I've read. Now we are getting to the drama and corruption at an interesting scale - the US Senate. And the portrait we have of Johnson is fascinating. \n Lyndon Johnson was just simply power hungry. He had no principles of note, no things he was on a mission to do - except to hold as much power as he could. But he was brilliant at reading people, knowing what they wanted, and finding ways to horse-trade in his huge and growing network - and help them get it. A genius at being a politician. But lacking principles - I hope there are politicians that can do both. \n But this is not just a book about LBJ and his time in the senate - it is a history of the senate, and of 1960's America. I didn't appreciate the power the Senate has in US politics - small numbers of senators can block legislation for a long time. The book hints that WWII can be blamed on the senate - because the president wanted to act against Hitler much earlier but the senate didn't let him - a crazy allegation if true. And the filibusters! I didn't appreciate what those really were and how powerful they were. It was also very impressive reading how quickly LBJ took over leadership of the Senate - most senators had to wait until they were old to have the seniority to do much - LBJ within two years of being a senator had become elected leader and then did away with the seniority rule - both unprecedented changes. \n And of course, much of the book is about the fact that the southern senators collaborated to prevent any civil rights legislation for 100 years. It was well into the 20th century before African Americans got the right to vote, and we removed segregation - and this delay is all due to the senate. \n LBJ is known for being the president who passed civil rights - but the story of how he was a \"southern senator\" (from Texas) who had the southern senators as his base, but had to pass civil rights bills through the senate in order to make the liberals believe he was on their side so he could have a presidential bid - was fascinating. He did it not caring a single bit about the actual cause - it was simply the only path to be president, as the country had hit a point where the northerners were no longer going to let segregation go on, and the southerners were only going to give it up over their dead bodies.

    "review_text": "A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn't put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \n \"I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know...\" \"What?\" \"So fragile.\" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" \n This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. \n If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. \n \"Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" Daniela says, \"Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don't cheat the system.\"",

    "review_text": "A fun, humorous, fast-paced, and fascinating take on what happens when an AI awakens. In order to tell this story, Reid invents a fictional Silicon Valley company called Pluttr, which seems sort of like a mashup of Snapchat+Facebook+WeChat but with more big data about us all, so it's able to really personalize it's experience. Frankly it seems like a good idea and where the afore mentioned companies are likely going. And this is one of my favorite things about good science fiction - it predicts the future. While not everything about this novel will come true, it is clear that Reid - who is a former tech CEO himself (and disclosure, a friend) - did his homework about technological trends and weaves them in nicely to a thrilling singularity story (Note: the book doesn't use the word \"singularity\" at all, in a homage to current silicon valley trends, because for some reason that I get but don't quite understand that word is passe - but instead to renames it \"the omega point\"). \n One of the most interesting aspects of the book for me is the fictional company Phluttr. I mean, when an AI finally awakens you'd have to put your money on Google doing it (if it happens in the private sector) - they are the furthest along in the intersection of having the key ingredients: lots of data about people, AI technology, and computing power. But I suppose it would be weird to use a real company - Dave Eggers The Circle was similar in describing a company that was basically FB+Google. But as I said, it does seem like the descriptions of Phluttr will happen, once the both the AI improves (pretty much possible now), the dataset known about each user vastly increases (happening in some pockets), and computing power improves (will be there soon). And thinking through the possibilities of what that will enable was super fun. For instance, there was an scene in the beginning of the book where Phluttr deduced that two of the characters were at the same bar and likely there on a date, and gave them coupons and messages/information appropriate to that deduction. \n One of the more interesting philosophical questions tackled by the book is: should we try to accelerate creation of a super AI? Since the first one created will have a decisive advantage and any other super AI's created will never catch up to its intelligence nor power. Many think that the creation of a super AI is inevitable anyways, and there is a chance that whoever creates it may retain some control or benefit - though there is a very high risk you wouldn't - which is the debate. The book has characters that take both sides of this question, but ultimately lands that major countries (US, China, others) will get into an \"arms race\" and strive to create it. Doesn't seem unlikely. AI in general (regardless of a super AI) will be the next nuclear arms race, no question - already is if you look at all the hacking and security issues (eg US presidential election). \n But don't let my introspections about the subject matter make you think this is a deep thinking AI book. It is a fast paced, fun thriller with a twist at the end. It's also got a good amount of self-deprecating-silicon-valley humor - eg I loved the fictional persuadif.er blog, with posts such as \"Eat on the phone\" and then you find poor characters like Pugwash doing just that. Or fun references thrown in like how Tim Tebow is now a VR tycoon (huh?). Bottom line: this captures interesting technological trends in a humorous & thrilling read - highly recommended!",

    "review_text": "A fascinating look at the early part of LBJ's life and career. This is the first of a four book series covering LBJ's life. At least 3 extremely smart people that I respect told me that this series was one of the best books they've ever read. I was also interested in reading about politics and corrupt politicians to get some grounding given the current political climate, and even in volume 1, this didn't disappoint. \n Many biographies spend way too much time on details that are not very relevant, especially in the early life, and this book was no exception - although I found the writing good and story compelling that I finished it rather quickly (also thanks to whispersync with Audible). The book covers Johnsons childhood up through age 32 when he as a congressman lost the race for senate to Pappy O'Daniel. Pappy O'Daniel by the way, sounds like fun character - totally unqualified to be governor or senator but elected b/c everyone knew him from his radio show. In terms of Johnsons childhood, it was oddly interesting to learn about the \"Hill Country\" of Texas and why those who have lived there have had such rough lives. \n I love biographies, as it's always fascinating to see what motivates successful people - where their drive comes from. With LBJ, Caro paints his motivation as initially coming from not wanting to grow up poor and in debt like his father. But then his motivation shifts to become more \"a hunger for power in its most naked form, for power not to improve the lives of others, but to manipulate and dominate them, to bend them to his will.\" \n Johnson's raw hunger for power, his desire to be someone, led him to work extremely hard. And not only himself, but also the people who worked for him. It was impressive how hard he worked himself and his small team when he was working as a congressional aide. And all driven by a lust for power. Interestingly to me, he picked exclusively people who were \"loyal\" to him - meaning he could work them to the bone - over people who were intelligent or experienced in what needed to be done. He was able to pull this off as in the post great depression era, a lot of people had no other way to get a job, or get ahead, and so LBJ had leverage. But LBJ did have a gift in picking and reading men, which was I think key to understanding his success. \n \"if Lyndon Johnson was not a reader of books, he was a reader of men-- a reader with a rare ability to see into their souls.\" \n And he was not only a reader of men - he could also remember everything about the people he met - he could impressively remember details about a persons son 10 years after meeting them. Great skill for a politician to have! He also had an uncanny ability to make older men look at him like a son - a skill he used with Speaker of the house Sam Rayburn, which greatly helped his career. \n Johnson also had no qualms cheating to steal elections - with both his election to school president in college, and the little congress, he cheated. \n A fascinating piece of LBJ was that he worked very hard to not commit to a public position on almost anything. He basically told people what he thought they wanted to hear - perhaps a hallmark of a corrupt politician. This gave him a lot of freedom to play both sides. Liberals literally thought he was liberal and conversatives thought he was conservative. Not the most moral of stances, but in that pre-internet age, more possible to pull off and even smart tactically. \n \"Once, a congressional aide, who had just heard him \"talking conservative\" with Martin Dies, came across him, \"not an hour later,\" \"talking liberal\" with Patman-- espousing a point of view diametrically opposite to the one he had been espousing sixty minutes before.\" \n A hallmark of the New Deal was helping people who needed it, and Johnson did help the poor farmers of Texas. I thought this quote was a powerful representation of the impact he had and why he kept getting elected: \n \"Oh my God,\" her mother said. \"The house is on fire!\" But as they got closer, they saw the light wasn't fire. \"No, Mama,\" Evelyn said. \"The lights are on.\" They were on all over the Hill Country. \"And all over the Hill Country,\" Stella Gliddon says, \"people began to name their kids for Lyndon Johnson.\"",

    "review_text": "A fascinating book about community and belonging, and how modern society has moved us away from our roots in potentially signifiant ways. The book opens with a thought provoking fact: in early America, there were numerous instances of white people joining primitive, native Indian societies - but zero instances of the opposite, because \"the intensely communal nature of an Indian tribe held an appeal that the material benefits of Western civilization couldn't necessarily compete with.\" \n The book also argues that the wealth we enjoy in modern society is isolating, against the grain of millions of years of our evolution, and can lead to depression, because our happiness is in large part rooted in a need to feel connected to others. While this feels right and intuitive, it doesn't seem to be the way we are optimizing our lives. \n \"A wealthy person who has never had to rely on help and resources from his community is leading a privileged life that falls way outside more than a million years of human experience. Financial independence can lead to isolation, and isolation can put people at a greatly increased risk of depression and suicide. This might be a fair trade for a generally wealthier society-- but a trade it is.\" \n Another loss the book points out is the loss of the transparency and social justice that being in a small community used to bring. When your neighbors and community members all know each other and what is going on with each other, group peer pressure tends to reward good actions and punish bad ones. The book points out that people wouldn't for instance cheat unemployment if their neighbors were paying for it and everyone knew what was happening. In anonymity we have lost a sense of responsibility to each other. \n Another data point about the power of human connection that a disaster, such as a war, can bring to a society. Junger talked about this in a recent guest post on the Goodreads blog, saying \"Time and time again in history, civilians have forged incredibly strong bonds in the face of wars and earthquakes and floods and gone on to miss those heady times of cooperation. Also demonstrating the power of bonding is the fact that one of the most devastating thing a soldier can face is the loss of a buddy. \"Interestingly, a strong bonding experience can also lead to social change - for instance: \"The coming-together that societies often experience during catastrophes is usually temporary, but sometimes the effect can last years or even decades. British historians have linked the hardships of the Blitz-- and the social unity that followed-- to a landslide vote that brought the Labour Party into power in 1945 and eventually gave the United Kingdom national health care and a strong welfare state.\" \n The book basically concludes that the largest cost or risk of modern society is the loss of community. This is something worth giving a lot of thought in terms of our priorities.",

    "review_text": "My first Scalzi book - and really enjoyed it. Delightful well written science fiction book set in the future in a time when humanity is spread out across space and can travel between planets using \"the flow\". \n I liked how this universe was entirely designed around one huge natural resource (the flow). The entire balance of power was created because the people who controlled the most valuable planet (Hub) started out as armed toll collectors. And from there they shared power with anyone who could contest them, and thus created lots of other Houses and Guilds. With this power dynamic established, the book then delves into the question of what happens if the main natural resource should change. \n One other thing that I liked even though it was minor to the book was how the emperox's all had all themselves recorded for their entire lives - all neurological happenings in their brains. This lets you create an AI against that dataset that let's you sort of recreate their personality. This idea is interesting, though I think if it did exist it would be much more transformative than it was represented in the book. However makes you wonder if people aren't already starting to do things like this.",

    "review_text": "I haven't read a ton of \"history of the world\" books, but this was fascinating. Highly recommended. I think the author is incredibly good at explaining and simplifying big concepts. He take on complex things like religion & capitalism and explains them in very simple terms that you likely hadn't thought about before. \n The history of religion chapter was very interesting. I hadn't thought about the fact that many early religions were animists or polytheists, or dualists. Nor the fact that they all sort of merged into todays concepts: \n \"monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts.\" \n There was a fascinating bit on the scientific mindset, and how it was key to Europe taking power. After the scientific revolution, they believed in science and its ability to let man discover new things, make more money, etc. This made them into explorers, whereas many other cultures remained very static. Great example of China having had gunpowder for hundreds of years but not using it for anything other than fireworks, and didn't invent the gun. Reminded me a bit of the Mindset. \n The chapter on capitalism was fascinating. There line about before its invention that the economy didn't grow, and was \"frozen\" as nobody poured money into new things, so there was no growth. Then the notion of credit was discovered, and as growth started, the combination snowballed. In 1500 the annual per capita production was $550 and today its $8,800 - this is an astounding increase, and all because of the virtuous growth cycle of capitalism: money is invested -> businesses grow -> people make money -> they invest their money. I never thought about the fact that reinvesting profits is a core piece of capitalism, but from this lens it really is. \n \"The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years - such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep.\" \n What I didn't see coming is how the end of the book was dedicated to human happiness. Fascinating questions to ask if we are happier today than 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. By metrics of death rate, average age of death and general health, we ought to be. But clearly peasants after the agricultural revolution were on average less happy than they were before as hunter-gatherers. And now we live in an always-on internet age, with pressure to continue growing our economy. So are we happier? It is the right question, in my opinion. The book then gave the basics of the happiness framework that I've also read in other places and believe in: that people are happy when they have 3 things: (1) Friends and family that love them (2) Are part of a community that makes them feel like they below (3) have a purpose to their life and feel like they are doing something meaningful. However, the book then adds onto this in another way that I have been learning about but hadn't put together with this: meditation. \n \"According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices.\" \n So the moral of the book is basically that we should all meditate a lot, stop worrying, and be happy with what we have.",

    "review_text": "I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. \n It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. \n The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated. \n But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: \n \"Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase \"it is as if\". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense.\" \n Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: \n Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?\" \n Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: \"It was a whiny culture, we were finding.\" \n Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. \n \"We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem.\" \n My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves.",

I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. \n That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. \n I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. \n This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.\"",

    "review_text": "If everyone in the world read this book, the world would instantly become a better place. Mental models, while never perfect, are very powerful tools, and Grant has come up with a compelling, research backed view of what makes some people successful, and others less so. \n Grant divided the world into givers, matchers, and takers. Through a lot of research, Grant determined that the most successful and the least successful people are often givers, that takers often do well but not over the long term, and the vast majority of people are matchers. Like all such categorizations (eg fixed vs growth mindset), it isn't perfect, which bothered me a little - until you realize that in different situations you can either be giving, taking, or matching, and there are probably people that favor one of those three more often than not. \n Grant used surveys to determine if people are givers, though its strange that he didn't expand on what type of questions are used to determine this, as it would have been insightful. Happily, Google works, and I found he does have such a test on his website. And I scored 53% giver! \n The book opens with a chapter about one of the best givers and people that I know, David Hornik, who funded the last company I worked at. So awesome to see him getting such an amazing shoutout - he deserves it! \n I liked the example of Ken Lay as a successful taker. \"When kissing up, takers are often good fakers.\" I do wonder how many successful \"takers\" there are out there that don't have anything bad happen to them though. The book does use Frank Lloyd Wright as such an example, which is a fascinating dichotomy. \n Other interesting ways to determine givers & takers: use of \"I\" vs \"we\", number of LinkedIn \n recommendations written vs received. \n This was a very powerful insight: \"people actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they're choosing on behalf of others than themselves.\". Eg: \"The solution was thinking about myself as an agent, an advocate for my family. As a giver, I feel guilty about pushing too much, but the minute I start thinking, 'I'm hurting my family, who's depending on me for this,' I don't feel guilty about pushing for that side.\" \n The book also explains why givers are also the most unsuccessful - they are too selfless. Successful givers balance giving to others while taking care of themselves. \"As Bill Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, \"there are two great forces of human nature: self-interest, and caring for others,\" and people are most successful when they are driven by a \"hybrid engine\" of the two. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.\" \n I liked the example of how with Freecycle, small numbers of givers could turn everyone into givers. I think Goodreads has had a similar journey with our community. It's kind of the definition of a community: \"If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they're more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get.\" \n Some other quotes I liked: \n \"highly talented people tend to make others jealous, placing themselves at risk of being disliked, resented, ostracized, and undermined. But if these talented people are also givers, they no longer have a target on their backs.\" \n \"For many years, psychologists believed that in any domain, success depended on talent first and motivation second. To groom world-class athletes and musicians, experts looked for people with the right raw abilities, and then sought to motivate them. If you want to find people who can dunk like Michael Jordan or play piano like Beethoven, it's only natural to start by screening candidates for leaping ability and an ear for music. But in recent years, psychologists have come to believe that this approach may be backward. In the 1960s, a pioneering psychologist named Raymond Cattell developed an investment theory of intelligence. He proposed that interest is what drives people to invest their time and energy in developing particular skills and bases of knowledge. Today, we have compelling evidence that interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.\"",

    "review_text": "I kind of loved this book because it give a lot of the \"why\" - the science - behind a lot of best practices. This is the kind of thing that helps me change my behavior - when I know how it works under the hood. \n The book is broken into a series of \"brain rules\" on different subjects. I'll list main takeaways: \n Exercise \n We all know it's good for us and it feels good and we should do it. The best quote here was \"Physical activity is cognitive candy.\" - also \"A lifetime of exercise results in a sometimes astonishing elevation in cognitive performance, compared with those who are sedentary.\" The basic science is that blood flow through your brain is good for it and increases brain activity. Tip: exercise before you need your brain to be at its best. \n Sleep \n First, great to have validation that there really are early birds and night owls. I'm definitely a night owl, despite my kids best efforts. The interesting implications of this for a company are that people are at their best - their most productive - at different times of the day - so building a culture that is flexible and let's people work their hours is key. The science about the history of naps and the fact that the mid-afternoon slump is a real thing was also very interesting. The studies about sleep loss being as cognitively limiting as alcohol were also illuminating. Another study showed sleeping on a problem really does work. \n But the most interesting thing about the sleep chapter was the section on dreaming and what it might mean. In particular, dreams may at least in large part be a method of neural network training to enforce learning. \"humans appear to replay certain learning experiences at night, during the slow-wave phase.\" \n Stress \n Too much stress is bad for you - our systems weren't designed for constant stress. If you have too much adreline in your system constantly it leads to scarred blood vessels and then eventually a stroke. But a little stress is good - our brains will remember things that we are stressed about better (eg avoid predators on the savannah). But too much (chronic) stress can overwhelms the brain and hurts learning and can even make you depressed. Chronic stress is often the culprit in grief, or high anxiety households. The worst kind of stress is the feeling that you have no control over the problem-- you are helpless. \n Wiring \n \"What you do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like-- it literally rewires it.\" \n Attention \n I've said for a long time that humans don't remember facts, we remember facts couched in emotions. We can easily recall all the strong emotional moments of our lives as if they happened yesterday. Now it's great to have the science behind this: emotions release dopamine, which greatly aids in memory and information processing. This means that people will relate better to products that bring up positive emotions for them. It also means that an emotional hook to lead into an idea or product will always work as it triggers the emotion in the person. \n \"Emotionally charged events are better remembered--for longer, and with more accuracy--than neutral events.\" \n Another interesting thing mentioned in this chapter is the 10 minute rule. We only have about 10 minutes of attention on something before we start to tune out. As the book says, \"This fact suggests a teaching and business imperative: Find a way to get and hold somebody's attention for 10 minutes, then do it again.\" \n To get an idea to stick you have to give people the mental model for it first - \"meaning before details\". Specifically, you need to: \"Give the general idea first, before diving into details, and you will see a 40 percent improvement in understanding.\" And then you also have to simplify and hammer home concepts and let people digest them - force-feeding too many concepts at once won't sink in. \n In terms of paying attention (vs automatic things like riding a bicycle), \"Multitasking, when it comes to paying attention, is a myth.\" - the brain can only pay attention to one thing at a time. \n Memory \n There are different types of memory: declarative (I can remember my address and SSN), non declarative (I can remember how to ride a bike), short term, and long term. Short term memory isn't converted to long term easily: \"People usually forget 90 percent of what they learn in a class within 30 days. And the majority of this forgetting occurs within the first few hours after class.\". Keys to doing so are coding in emotion (why word association works), and repetition (\"repeat to remember\"). Also, thinking about what tree the person will mentally group the information and how to increase entry points or create strong ones. \n Interestingly, \"Memory worked best, it appeared, if the environmental conditions at retrieval mimicked the environmental conditions at encoding.\". This means if you learn something sad you will remember it better if you get sad again. Fascinating. This makes sense, as our brains must group similar patterns it remembers together. To get practical, you can create science, art, language stations to help people remember better. \n We all know this to be true - our memory isn't perfect. This is because we remember patterns, not facts or single instances. \"Our brains give us only an approximate view of reality, because they mix new knowledge with past memories and store them together as one.\" \n Another tidbit I liked, that fits in the \"repeat to remember\" bucket: \"A great deal of research shows that thinking or talking about an event immediately after it has occurred enhances memory for that event\". Basically the more an idea can be repeated - especially in timed intervals - the more chance it has of being encoded from short term to long term memory. \n Sensory Integration \n We remember data from each of our senses, and we learn best if we stimulate multiple senses concurrently. You remember better if you see AND hear something, or even if given words and pictures. Smells or sounds or tastes can trigger additional associations or emotions and help us create positive or negative associations to things we see or do. This is why people who haven't adopted digital reading say things like \"I love the smell of a good book\", this is why smelling fresh roasted coffee is a key part of Starbucks playbook. Smells have the power to bring back memories that are associated with them. \n Vision \n Vision trumps and overrides all other senses. I loved the story about the wine experts who were fooled by white wine with red dye in it because their eyes said it was red wine. Fascinating to read about the science of how the brain takes in the signals from the eyes, combines both signals, and applies pattern matching to fill in details. This means the brain has creative freedom to insert whatever it wants into our vision. \n Practical applications: our vision is caught by bold colors, orientations, motion. We remember images better than words because it's easier to pattern match the image, so use images in presentations. \n Music \n Music makes us more empathic - we can better recognize the emotions in speech, which helps in social abilities. Making music is 10x better for kids than listening to baby einstein CD's. Listening to music reduced cortisol and stress. \n Gender \n Boys and girls have different brain structures. When under stress, men remember the gist of things better, and women remember details and emotions. These quotes describe it well: \n \"The difference between girls' and boys' communication could be described as the addition of a single powerful word. Boys might say, \"Do this.\" Girls would say, \"Let's do this.\" \n \"When girl best friends communicate with each other, they lean in, maintain eye contact, and do a lot of talking. They use their sophisticated verbal talents to cement their relationships. Boys never do this. They rarely face each other directly, preferring either parallel or oblique angles. They make little eye contact, their gaze always casting about the room. They do not use verbal information to cement their relationships. Instead, commotion seems to be the central currency of a little boy's social economy. Doing things physically together is the glue that cements their relationships.\" \n \"In our evolutionary history, having a team that could understand both the gist and details of a given stressful situation helped us conquer the world. Why would the world of business be exempted from that advantage? Having an executive team or work group capable of simultaneously understanding both the emotional forests and the trees of a stressful project, such as a merger, might be a marriage made in business heaven. It could even affect the bottom line.\" \n Exploration \n We learn by doing, by exploring the world. We take pleasure in that exploration. Discovery based learning is best. Medical school offers the best on the job learning - other types of education should do better to model it. Learn and be curious.",

    "review_text": "I think this is a must read for any leader in a modern business. Google has done a lot of things right both in their products and also in how they run their company and build their culture, and this is a fairly detailed account of how they've built an impressive culture, and is written by someone who knows - their head of HR. I'm a little surprised he told as much as he did - but I suppose it will only help for recruiting. \n Goodreads is now a subsidiary of Amazon, and I have spent significant time learning to integrate the best of Amazons culture with ours. And I'm happy to say that many - perhaps most - of the best practices listed in the book are also used by Amazon. Things like hiring people smarter than you, hiring committees and having objective people on them, committees to approve promotions, focusing on the two tails, and more. These don't seem to be things all companies do yet - but should. \n So while much of the practices were things I'm already doing or aware of - there was a lot I learned from the book too. Here are some of the bigger takeaways I had. \n One of the more interesting ones was the notion to separate performance reviews from compensation discussions. This makes a lot of sense, is something we have already been making progress towards, and is something I'm going to think about more. \n \"Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve.\" If you want people to grow, don't have those two conversations at the same time. Make development a constant back-and-forth between you and your team members, rather than a year-end surprise.\" \n Another one was giving managers a bi-annual scorecards from their directs on how they did on ~10 dimensions that Google has determined are the determinants of a great manager. And no surprise (but very important to keep in mind), the book found that \"manager quality was the single best predictor of whether employees would stay or leave, supporting the adage that people don't quit companies, they quit bad managers.\" While we do a lot of surveys, we haven't packaged up the managers feedback into a report like this, and I think that would be powerful. \n Laszlo was impressive in citing lots of research to prove his points. It was one of my more favorite things about the book - he is clearly a student of human development. This led to lots of tidbits that apply pretty broadly, and which are great things to keep in mind when building a business. \n The chapter on nudges was I think my favorite in the book. Pretty cool the depth to which they have taken these - reminds me a lot of the onboarding funnel analysis I've done for Goodreads - paying attention to where you can message timely, relevant, easily actionable messages that will result in people taking desired actions, and a/b testing the results. Pretty impressive they a/b test that kind of stuff at Google! Examples given were around lists on how to onboard someone as a manager, how to be onboarded as a newbie, how to get more people to save money earlier in life and enroll in the 401K program (his data here was impressive - on how people of the same income bracket vary widely on wealth accumulated in their lives based purely on how much they save when they are young), and how to get people to eat healthier by putting the healthier foods in the kitchens more prominently. \n \"Nudges are an incredibly powerful mechanism for improving teams and organizations. They are also ideally suited to experimentation, so can be tested on smaller populations to fine-tune their results.\" \n Laszlo did a great job of explaining a lot of the psychology behind nudges too. My favorite was the research about checklists, and story about how the Airforce found that even the smartest, best trained pilots can make mistakes, but having checklists reduces their error rates significantly. \n \"I realized that management too is phenomenally complex. It's a lot to ask of any leader to be a product visionary or a financial genius or a marketing wizard as well as an inspiring manager. But if we could reduce good management to a checklist, we wouldn't need to invest millions of dollars in training, or try to convince people why one style of leadership is better than another. We wouldn't have to change who they were. We could just change how they behave.\" \n \"It turns out checklists really do work, even when the list is almost patronizingly simple. We're human, and we sometimes forget the most basic things.\" \n Another thing I loved was the focus on identifying the people who are best at a specific skill, and designing a program for them to teach that skill to others. G2G (Googlers 2 Googlers). \n \"Giving employees the opportunity to teach gives them purpose. Even if they don't find meaning in their regular jobs, passing on knowledge is both inspiring and inspirational.\" \n I liked his descriptions of deliberate learning. He gave examples of asking after every meeting \"what did we learn and how could we do better in the future\". And the story about Tiger hitting golf balls at 4am in the rain was pretty sweet. \n \"Ericsson refers to this as deliberate practice: intentional repetitions of similar, small tasks with immediate feedback, correction, and experimentation.\" \n My favorite tidbit - which I know to be true but is something great to keep in mind - is how to motivate people: let them connect to the people their work is helping. \n \"even a small connection to the people who benefit from your work not only improves productivity, it also makes people happier. And everyone wants their work to have purpose. \n Bock, Laszlo (2015-04-07). Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead (pp. 340-341).

    "review_text": "A decent book about Google from it's former CEO and head of product. I am only giving it 3 stars because a lot of it was too vague to be useful or stuff I already knew. However every 5 or 10 pages there was a nugget, or reminder of something I knew but that was good to think about. Also good to see a lot of this all written down in one place. So worthwhile overall, though it did take me a while to plow through. \n Eric spent a lot of time talking about product excellence. In todays crowded market, products that are better than the rest are the ones that succeed. Better design, functionality, even speed. \n \"product excellence is now paramount to business success--not control of information, not a stranglehold on distribution, not overwhelming marketing power\" \n There was also a lot of discussion about how to lead a engineering and product led organization - which is absolutely critical in a technology company. Also discussion how to scale a company and hire smart people. Eric used the prhase \"smart creatives\" to describe the kind of people who will be successful in a technology company - though I'm not so sure they are such a new breed as he makes out. But anyways: identify smart creative people who like tech. Then find those who have the biggest impact and give them more to do, and lots of autonomy. \n The below was another obvious-yet-interesting-to-think about philosophy of Google's. A good question to ask in any new product or feature is always what technical innovation it has. \n \"Basing products on technical insights has always been a core principle of Google, but its importance became even more clear to us in 2009, when we reviewed our product line and started to see a pattern emerging: The best products had achieved their success based on technical factors, not business ones, whereas the less stellar ones lacked technical distinction.\" \n This is another quote that I think is a key to success and scaling a company: \n \"The simple way to keep recruiting in everyone's job description is to measure it. Count referrals and interviews. Measure how quickly people fill out interview feedback forms. Encourage employees to help with recruiting events, and track how often they do. Then make these metrics count when it comes to performance reviews and promotions. Recruiting is everyone's job, so grade it that way.\" \n Other good tips: \n * keep details about projects people are doing in your phone address book so you can easily look them up anywhere. \n * Once a year write a self-review and share it with the people you work with. \n * Clean out your inbox down to 5 emails or less each day. \n * In a fast paced business the best/only way to get things done is relationships, so pay attention to those. \n * OKR's and why it's good to stretch yourself, and make them public. \n * 70/20/10 for resource allocation: 70% on the core business, 20% on emerging, 10% on new. \n * The way to improve a product is to challenge your smart people. Eg \"these ads suck\"",

    "review_text": "Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). \n One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive. \n \"the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.\" \n Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: \n \"In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path.\" \n Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies. \n There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. \n My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.",

    "review_text": "I love Stephenson - and this was another hit - absolutely loved it. The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception. \n It was really two books, and I certainly didn't see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don't have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. \n The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives. \n I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting. And of course, the whole notion of Cradle was just cool - though not sure about it's feasibility.",

    "review_text": "An interesting book that describes Howards return to CEO and the challenges of getting Starbucks back on track after massive scaling and the economic downturn of 2008 left it in a vulnerable position. \n Howard comes across as someone that loves Starbucks - the company he created. His passion for innovation and coffee and making it work are infectious, and learning a little about his leadership style was very interesting. I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of how Starbucks went astray as it had scaled to over 20 thousand stores, and how he tackled bringing it back. \"The Transformation Agenda\" - because sometimes if you give change a name people will believe it's coming. \n I enjoyed reading about the campaign to close all Starbucks stores to let employees watch a training video. A big statement, one that was very public, and acknowledged they knew they had issues they need to improve. Bold move, and a respected one. \n My only criticism of the book is that it comes across as a lot of corporate speak. I'm not saying it's inauthentic, just that the kind of language that he needs to motivate his employees is likely different what what he needed to put in this book. But he's clearly an inspirational leader. \n Howard spent a lot of time focused creating a quality experience for his customers. He realized that every piece of the Starbucks experience was crucial to building a top tier brand that stood for quality and a place that people would want to spend time at. From the smell of coffee in the store (and the related battle to have or not have cheese sandwiches), to choices people have, to the interactions with the baristas. The baristas were crucial, because with over 20 thousand stores, he had to create programs to train them and make sure they had the right values and approach. \n I still love my Blue Bottle, but I have more respect when I walk into a Starbucks store now.",

    "review_text": "I haven't read many (any?) books that are written by CEO's for CEO's. If you are a CEO, aspire to be a CEO, or really, manage anyone - you need to read this book. \n This quote is perhaps my favorite one from the book. At the top, nobody is there to tell you what to do. It's easy to look at some leaders and wonder how they knew what to do to become so successful. Are they just really smart? The truth is that they likely did what everyone else in that situation has to do - get scrappy and just figure it out - and don't give up. \n \"Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary cofounder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls \"the torture.\" Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, \"I didn't quit.\" \n My second favorite quote from the book speaks to one of the greatest challenges all entrepreneurs face: work/life balance. I like to say \"work hard, play hard\". But sometimes it's easy to forget the play part. Or to buy flowers once in a while. But the cost of those on your health or relationships can cost much more. \n \"As a company grows, communication becomes its biggest challenge. If the employees fundamentally trust the CEO, then communication will be vastly more efficient than if they don't.\" \n Ben had a lot of great advice on how to hire well, especially executives. Looking to avoid reactionary big company execs when you need someone who will come in and get stuff done proactively. Looking for people who can think on their feet and not make everything a nail for the hammer of their prior experience by asking \"How will your new job differ from your current one?\" Looking for people who are mission driven and use the \"team\" prism instead of the \"me\" prism. He also had advice about onboarding, and training. \n Hiring for strength instead of lack of weakness. I've definitely seen instances of this - where a candidate is great in some areas that we really need but isn't great at everything. Knowing what you value most is critical here - and I fully admit - not easy to do. \n \"I'd learned the hard way that when hiring executives, one should follow Colin Powell's instructions and hire for strength rather than lack of weakness.\" \n On hiring internally vs externally. Internal candidates across often do better, which is a great thing to think about when building a team. \n \"when it comes to CEO succession, internal candidates dramatically outperform external candidates . The core reason is knowledge. Knowledge of technology, prior decisions, culture, personnel, and more tends to be far more difficult to acquire than the skills required to manage a larger organization.\" \n One of my favorite sections was \"Managing strictly by numbers is like painting by numbers\". No matter how well you instrument your metrics and goals, you can ever perfectly encapsulate everything you need your company to be doing. Innovation is often like this - with many big innovations the team will often struggle to find how it drives value as it doesn't seem to hit the core metric. But they can all agree it will improve things. I think a big part of the CEO's job is to have a strong product vision, and to not compromise on it. \n \"I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product.\" \n Ben talked about the difference between CEO's who can set direction for a company (often founding CEO's) and those can can operationally run it as it grows. How great CEOs need to be good at both, and founding CEOs who don't scale are those who don't learn the operational side. And conversely, operational CEOs who don't get good at making decisions about direction will fail. \n Ben talked about how \"Some employees make products, some make sales; the CEO makes decisions.\" The strength of those decisions is built upon having data. Data about what customers think. Data about what employees think. Data about the metrics. A CEO has to be a constant data accumulating machine. Another nuance was that a CEO can make a decision at any point in time with the data they have now, identify what data would change their mind, and seek it out. \n \"Great CEOs build exceptional strategies for gathering the required information continuously. They embed their quest for intelligence into all of their daily actions from staff meetings to customer meetings to one-on-ones. Winning strategies are built on comprehensive knowledge gathered in every interaction the CEO has with an employee, a customer, a partner, or an investor.\" \n Ben's stories about Loudcloud and Opsware and the Hard Things he dealt with were impressive. I do think they spread too much throughout the book and would have been better concentrated in one part of the book and supplemented by more examples from other companies. But that doesn't detract from one can learn from them. It was strange that he opens each chapter with rap lyrics - that often seem very disconnected to the chapter. I guess he likes rap - but still... \n Pretty cool Ben had Michael Ovitz as an advisor. And that he modeled A16Z after CAA - where instead of independent agents/VCs, have a shared network - and invest in strategic networks that will help the companies. \n Michael Ovitz on dealmaking: \"Gentlemen, I've done many deals in my lifetime and through that process, I've developed a methodology, a way of doing things, a philosophy if you will. Within that philosophy, I have certain beliefs. I believe in artificial deadlines. I believe in playing one against the other. I believe in doing everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done.\" \n One interesting tendency Ben points out is that \"When a company starts to lose its major battles, the truth often becomes the first casualty.\". You have to be vigilant in looking for the truth, and have backbone spot it. The reason for this, is that \"humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news.\" Which is so true! We can always find reasons to excuse away bad news, and reasons to believe good news means more than it should. \n Ben closes with a quote I really believe in - life is about the journey, not the destination. So you have to embrace the journey. Be so mission driven that the struggles you inevitably face are worth it. \"Life is struggle.\" I believe that within that quote lies the most important lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.\"",

    "review_text": "A beautiful story. Neil Gaiman is truly a unique storyteller. I did a combo of reading and listening to this story, and Neil is great at reading as well. I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). \n I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it's creative, magical, and really, just right. \n Go and catch a falling star, \n Get with child a mandrake root, \n Tell me where all past years are, \n Or who cleft the devil's foot, \n Teach me to hear mermaids singing, \n Or to keep off envy's stinging, \n And find \n What wind \n Serves to advance an honest mind. \n If thou be'st born to strange sights, \n Things invisible to see, \n Ride ten thousand days and nights, \n Till age snow white hairs on thee, \n Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, \n All strange wonders that befell thee, \n And swear, \n No where \n Lives a woman true, and fair. \n If thou find'st one, let me know, \n Such a pilgrimage were sweet; \n Yet do not, I would not go, \n Though at next door we might meet; \n Though she were true, when you met her, \n And last, till you write your letter, \n Yet she \n Will be \n False, ere I come, to two, or three. \n And here is my new favorite quote: \"Have been unavoidably detained by the world.

    "review_text": "I couldn't put this book down. It was well written - even elegant in a way, as well as though provoking. I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas's for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. \n Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. \n If there is a motto of the book, it's probably this quote: \"Because survival is insufficient\". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. \n \"All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient.\" \n \"Survival might be insufficient, she'd told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare.\" \n The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won't say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I'm glad I'm not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. \n Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything. Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little - though I know it will fade as months and years go by. \n ps. This is cool:",

    "review_text": "Recommend this highly for anyone who works in a technology or creative field. Pixars track records is unparalleled - 14 movies and all of them have been massive hits. I had two important takeaways from this book: how to build a great, lasting culture, and how to build a creative company. \n Catmull's philosophy both around creating movies and managing his company, is to be relentless about remembering that he doesn't know what he doesn't know. In creating a movie, you don't know what it will be when you start. In creating a company, you similarly don't know what it will be, especially at first. But equally importantly when you are scaling it, you don't know the dynamics of what is happening throughout the company - you will have a filtered view based on the (always) incomplete picture you can see. So you have to relentlessly have the mindset to remember that there are dynamics at play that you don't know, and look for them. \n \"From that day on, I resolved to bring as many hidden problems as possible to light, a process that would require what might seem like an uncommon commitment to self-assessment.\" \n \"I believe the best managers acknowledge and make room for what they do not know--not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur.\" \n So how did Pixar build 14 hits in a row? They created a highly leveraged feedback loop. They created a culture of open feedback, and encourage anyone in the room - regardless of rank - to have an equal voice. They have lots of ways to get feedback on the film and iterate on it: from daily standup every morning to review scenes, up to braintrust meetings with all the best directors and creative minds to review the story. They spend a lot of time - years - iterating on and nailing the story before putting it into production - and even then they keep iterating. Nothing trumps good story. \n \"Braintrust meetings require giving candid notes, but they do a great deal more than that. The most productive creative sessions allow for the exploration of myriad trains of thought.\" \n \"The first step is to teach them that everyone at Pixar shows incomplete work, and everyone is free to make suggestions. When they realize this, the embarrassment goes away--and when the embarrassment goes away, people become more creative.\" \n \"in Japanese Zen, that idea of not being constrained by what we already know is called \"beginner's mind.\" And people practice for years to recapture and keep ahold of it.\" \n I loved the concept of \"the beast\" - which is the trap of needing to continue to succeed a higher and higher levels. \"It is one of life's cruel ironies that when it comes to feeding the Beast, success only creates more pressure to hurry up and succeed again.\" An important point to this was that feeding the beast means bigger and better, and taking less risks. To create something new, you have to have the right leadership to shelter the seed and let it grow. \n The stories about Steve Jobs were great. Made you respect him even more. For taking a huge financial risk to spin Pixar out of Lucasfilms and then personally float it for a long time, taking even more risk. I loved hearing about how much foresight he had with regards to Disney and negotiating that deal. I also loved the story about the wide screen - basically how Steve responds to passion, and pushes people until he finds where it is. This quote explains it well: \n His method for taking the measure of a room was saying something definitive and outrageous--\"These charts are bullshit!\" or \"This deal is crap!\"--and watching people react. If you were brave enough to come back at him, he often respected it--poking at you, then registering your response, was his way of deducing what you thought and whether you had the guts to champion it.\"",

    "review_text": "What a fun series. I loved Wool, and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up. I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion. \n It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. \n There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? \n Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. \n What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? \n The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. \n I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. \n If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.",

    "review_text": "A classic dystopian novel published in 1985, but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate. I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling. \n This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a \"hand maiden\" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called \"Offred\" because she is the property \"of Fred\". \n \"We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice.\" \n A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. \n \"Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.\" \n This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable: \n \"We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.\"",

    "review_text": "Great explanation of the theory of constraints and operations management. It's a business classic- first published in 1984 - but still relevant as it gets at the fundamentals. I almost removed a star for trying to create a fictional story to tell the book in that was badly told/edited. Did we really need the side story about the protagonists marital issues? \n One of the biggest takeaways from this book is that it's incredibly important to set the right goals to manage a complex operation. This sounds obvious and intuitive, however it's actually much harder than most people think, and easy to get wrong. It gets down to the question of: is everyone working on the \"right things\". The things that will lead to the business making the most money. It's too easy to find a things that are easily measurable and saying \"this thing is correlated with our success, so let's focus on it\". It sounds like \"cost accounting\" fit into that bucket. \n \"What you're saying is that making an employee work and profiting from that work are two different things.\" \n So how do you set the right goals? Focus on making money! \n \"So this is the goal: To make money by increasing net profit, while simultaneously increasing return on investment, and simultaneously increasing cash flow.\" \n One of the drivers of making money in any business that creates a product is throughput, or how fast a product can be made. The others are costs/operating expenses, and inventory. One of the key concepts of the book is that focusing on throughput rather than costs will yield much better results. \n \"The entire bottleneck concept is not geared to decrease operating expense, it's focused on increasing throughput.\" \n The bottleneck theory, or the theory of constraints, was very useful to think about. My company produces software and not physical products, but each feature we develop definitely has steps it has to go through: creating the concept, research, spec, design, implementation (backend and client), testing, QA, measure results, analyze them, iterate, etc. Focusing on where the bottlenecks are with that process can help us move faster. And every startup needs to be moving fast - and not just at building - we need to be doing build, measure, learn as fast as we can. \n A consequence of the bottleneck theory that is useful to keep in mind is that in any system only the bottlenecks should be 100% utilized. Every manager will have a natural tendency to want to utilize all their resources to 100% because that just seems... wasteful if you don't. People should be working full time right? But a system can only run at the speed of the slowest bottleneck, so non-bottlenecks will by definition have spare cycles, and it's important to keep them open for the important work and not fill it up with unimportant stuff that will bog them down when you actually need them on the important stuff. \n I've seen this happen many times in software. An engineer finishes a project, and the big important project coming from the design team isn't done yet, so he picks up something small in the meantime. The next day that big important project is ready to go, but the engineer only needs \"one more day\" to finish this thing he started. And then that day becomes two and then three (because we didn't count QA). And then we've lost 3 days on our most important project for another project that doesn't matter at all. Add that up across a large number of developers, and you've lost a lot of time. \n The theory of constraints is not limited to manufacturing, as the author shows. In the end, he is advocating it as a method or process of learning. \n STEP 1. Identify the system's bottlenecks. \n STEP 2. Decide how to exploit the bottlenecks. \n STEP 3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision. \n STEP 4. Elevate the system's bottlenecks. \n STEP 5. If, in a previous step, a bottleneck has been broken go back to step 1.",

    "review_text": "Mark Watney is a steely-eyed missile man. A man's man. A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong, and left to fend for himself. I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip, and it flew by - what a fun story. Not surprised at all it's being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon. Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. \n There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn't double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. \n But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. \n \"I started the day with some nothin' tea. Nothin' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin'.\" \n \"Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.\" \n \"Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie.\" \n In the end, a well told story of survival against the odds. And one of belief - I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch - you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get. We humans love a good surviving against the odds story.",

    "review_text": "An amazing and unique creation: JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst created what reads like a classic work of fiction - something you can easily imagine having read in English class - and then wrote a intriguing side story in the margins. A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. \n The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I'm reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. \n The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it's a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like \"relationships\" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. \n One thing I didn't realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it's an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It's a ship that can't die. Or a series of ships :) \n I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don't understand it all. But don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka's regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn't really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.",

    "review_text": "One of the best books on leadership I've read. Many people struggle to articulate what leadership really is. This book put a more fine point on it, suggesting that leadership is creating change. The author likes the word \"adaptive change\". Once a solution to an issue has been accepted and is in motion, it becomes a management issue - a matter of execution - not a leadership issue. Creating change is not easy: \n An adaptive change that is beneficial to the organization as a whole may clearly and tangibly hurt some of those who had benefited from the world being left behind. \n An important point the book made was people can generally only stand so much change at a time. So you have to limit the amount of change you are creating at any given point. A leader also helps people get through the change. They have to acknowledge the change and that it will be difficult, and convincingly paint the picture of why it's worth going through. \n When you lead people through difficult change, you take them on an emotional roller coaster because you are asking them to relinquish something--a belief, a value, a behavior--that they hold dear. People can stand only so much change at any one time. \n Another good concept was that of finding the \"orienting value\", and finding ways to drive it home and constantly remind people of it. For instance, Roosevelts New Deal or MLK's I Have A Dream speech. Create an image that people can latch onto and keep repeating that everywhere. \n To sustain momentum through a period of difficult change, you have to find ways to remind people of the orienting value--the positive vision--that makes the current angst worthwhile. \n Sometimes, conflict has to be worked out among constituents instead of having a solution dictated. I loved the story about Scottie Pippen disobeying Phil Jackson, and then Jackson saying to the team What happened has hurt us. Now you have to work this out. and then leaving the room. Solutions are often achieved when the people with the problem go through the process of creating the solution together. \n I liked how the book got into the deeper meaning of life in the end. I've always believed that people need purpose in life, and the authors confirmed that, but warned against getting too wedded to one particular purpose. A useful reminder that the person makes the purpose, not the other way around. We can love our jobs, but it's dangerous to let them define us.",

    "review_text": "I tore through The Pillars of the Earth, and couldn't wait to pick this up. Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn't a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. \n I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases. Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor - instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.",

    "review_text": "Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. \n One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to \"scratch the itch\" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. \n \"Once a technology has created an association in users' minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.\" \n I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters! \n Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc. \n there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.\" \n Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it. \n \"For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.\" \n \"frequent engagement with a product--especially over a short period of time--increases the likelihood of forming new routines.\" \n The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started.",

    "review_text": "5 stars for being a un-put-downable page-turner, full of interesting and engaging characters I empathized with, and for teaching me about the politics and religion of the middle ages. Follet is a thriller writer, and it shows. \n Fascinating that in medieval times, most villages were surrounded by walls (or were inside a castle) - because you couldn't count on the law to marauding rival lords from raping and pillaging your village. And the largest buildings other than the local lords castle, were cathedrals. Why did people spend so much time an energy building these huge monuments to God that took 10-20 years to build? The book explains that bit, with the importance of the Church in society and it's relation to the crown. \n I am having trouble putting my finger on what I liked about the book. To friends who asked, I can't sell it every well. But it was a epic saga of love and power, and I loved every second. I think in the end, the lesson was that creating enemies leads you to get what you deserve. This might be a good summary of the book: \n \"The duck swallows the worm, the fox kills the duck, the men shoot the fox, and the devil hunts the men.\" \n For the record, I hate William Hamleigh. I love Jack - he reminds me a bit of Howard Roark. And Aliena was inspirational. Philip was a prude but a good dude - I still can't believe he forgave Remigius. Interestingly, Waleran is once described as good person who just misunderstood his priorities - but I don't buy that.",

    "review_text": "The Circle is a new bay area company, but is really Google+Facebook. It dominates search and social media, has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay, and is full of intelligent, ambitious young employees. This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us. It's essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness, and I think a serious 1984-esque warning about being too open. \n I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic. The characters weren't very well developed. And I can't imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too - it was just too extreme to believe. But I suppose that was on purpose, as the author was just making a point. I appreciated the point (see below), but didn't love the story. \n Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one. The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident - if your whole life is open to your friends and family, it's very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret. The premise of the Circle - that privacy and secrecy are bad - is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness. Or as its motto says: \n All That Happens Must Be Known. \n It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates. With public video cameras everywhere that document everything we do, and tons more data (photos, videos, texts) available to search engines to scan through. Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived. There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use. I heard of another startup that puts a video camera on you and it takes photos of everything all day and creates a montage of your day that is searchable/sortable for you. In many ways, we should already start acting like everything we do at least outside of our homes is being recorded on camera. \n I think the central question the book poses is the one Bailey contemplates with Mae: is there such a thing as a good secret? Should we have privacy at all? Or would the world at large be better off if all secrets are known? I think we know where Mr Eggers stands on the subject, as the book seemed to be written in a dystopian, mocking kind of way. But it is in an interesting thought experiment, as many secrets would ultimately be better overall (not necessarily for the disclosing party, but for the overall situation), if they were known. For example you don't want to tell your friend that you know their significant other is cheating on them b/c you aren't supposed to know, but ultimately it would be better for them to know. Can you think of a secret you know that should be a secret? \n But of course, there are lots of secrets that should stay secrets. Ignorance often truly is bliss, and people often just need to be weird and express themselves in ways that not everyone would appreciate if it were open. We are private beings, and yet our dignity and sense of self-worth largely stems from how others perceive us. I think this book is a thought-provoking story that shows us how our society is changing.",

    "review_text": "I think there is one big idea to Slack that makes it worth reading for anyone dealing with leadership or leading at scale. A lot of the rest of the book is fairly obvious or not practical, so not giving it five stars. \n The big idea of this book is that creativity can't be rushed, and if you don't build the slack into your schedule to spend some time creatively thinking about your business, you won't be able to innovate. You will only be able to be reactive, not proactive. The \"Hurry Up\" mindset is so easy to slip into - because there is always more to do than there is time. Providing a theory and data around the fact that having slack in your schedule is not only ok, but it's a good thing, is almost counter-intuitive, and thus really valuable to think about. \n The book talks about how some companies slip into a \"hurry up\" mindset where everyone wants to look busy all the time. The danger of being busy is that you can too easily - especially if you are only being reactive - be busy on working on the wrong stuff. \n \"Very successful companies have never struck me as particularly busy; in fact, they are, as a group, rather laid-back. Energy is evident in the workplace, but it's not the energy tinged with fear that comes from being slightly behind on everything.\" \n When managing people there is another kind of slack that the book points out: the slack to give up control to someone. Highly functioning people like to own their goals and process and have leeway to accomplish them on their own. As a manager, one of the hardest tasks is to balance giving them that autonomy with occasionally checking in or diving in to make sure things are on track. If you do it too much, you will annoy people or cause them to leave - if you do it too little your team could be wasting time heading in the wrong direction. \n Other interesting points: \n * In a hurry up organization, there is a natural tendency to try to get people to work harder/more to meet deadlines. While this can work over short stints, it's generally not sustainable. In fact, the book had a bunch of data to show that on average overtime hours aren't more productive. \n * They analyzed the \"star performers\" in a number of companies, and the only thing they had in common they could point to was the strength of their networks. Establishing good connections and doing favors for others let's you get stuff done faster when you need to. \n * The book makes a point that setting Quality goals for companies can be dangerous b/c you can so easily focus on the wrong metrics. For instance, reducing the number of bugs is correlated with quality, but it isn't the same thing as making a great product. This seems pretty obvious, so I'm not sure why it needed to be included in the book. \n * It's important to set a vision for the organizations culture. The culture are those things that are so important to the organization that they should never change. If a organization lacks those, it will define itself as status quo and resist all change. \n * Effective leaders build up trust, often before they've even earned it. The most effective way to do this is to acquire trust by giving trust. The act of giving trust is an enormously powerful gesture. The author told a story about a woman giving him her 2 year old daughter to carry off the plane. The trust she showed impressed him. \n A great summary of the book: \n \"Reinvention takes place in the middle of the organization, so the first requisite is that there has to be a middle. I'll assume your organization still has one. Now pour in some slack, increase safety, and take steps to break down managerial isolation. Viola, the formula for middle-of-the-hierarchy reinvention.\"",

    "review_text": "A fascinating in-depth and well researched look at the processed food industry. I recommend this for anyone who buys food at a grocery or convenience store (aka everyone). I read this book hoping to learn more about processed foods and how to avoid them, and I definitely got what I was looking for. Before reading this I was trying to avoid processed foods, and this book has helped increase that resolve, as well as educated me more on how to do it. It is absolutely amazing and frightening how many processed foods - some of which I remember fondly like Capri Sun - have enough salt/sugar/fat to easily account for a quarter or half of your daily recommended limit. This makes it super easy to go way over, and the result is unhealthy, fat Americans. \n One of the more powerful things of this book was that Moss went deep into the food industry to really understand the dynamics at play. He didn't just demonize them for making the US one of the fattest countries in the world. He interviewed dozens of insiders - current and retired, to get their perspectives. \n And the bottom line is scary. The food industry has zero incentive to produce healthier food. Because the high calorie food that they make that is stuffed with salt, sugar, and fat sells really well. It's tasty and convenient and cheap, and people buy whats tasty, and have no time or money to make or buy healthier options. And when the industry has tried to reduce the salt, sugar or fat, every time they find that it doesn't sell as well. Sure they have made some incremental improvements here and there, but by and large, the grocery store is a scary place if you don't want to vastly exceed your daily caloric intake. \n It seems clear to me that things will never get better without government intervention - something that Moss also concludes in the book. Trying to understand a food label is impossible for most people, as (1) you have to know by heart the daily recommended values for calories, salt, sugar, and fat, and (2) you have to do math to figure out how many servings you are eating. Doing both of these just won't happen for 99% of the population, and thus we are where we are. We cannot rely on the food industry to make healthier products - we have make them do so by choosing with our wallets. \n In my opinion, the FDA or someone in the government needs to get a good designer to fix food labels and get them to a state where any American can easily look at them and go \"oh my gosh this [can of pasta sauce] will account for [a quarter] of my daily recommended [caloric/protein/fat/sugar] intake if I eat it\". Maybe some startup can combine a phone camera and some image recognition to do this. The right organization to drive this is the FDA, but they are not acting. \n So why doesn't the government act to prevent the obesity epidemic (and yes, that word is appropriate)? Moss spends a bit of time in the book examining this question, interviewing people at the FDA and the Dept of Agriculture. His conclusion is that they aren't incentivized or enabled to act. The food industry is well capitalized and has - for some inescapable reason to me - been able to fight every report of how bad their products are. Regulation is a tricky subject in America, but it seems that even the role of getting information to Americans about how to protect their health is completely broken. \n One of the more interesting things I learned from the book is how sophisticated the food industry is in marketing their products. Their segmentation is impressive, and they find the right products, messages and mediums for each segment. They have learned to be on top of trends and perform slight of hand tricks with ease. For instance Americans initially loved their breakfasted cereals when marketed using the word \"sugar\". When people finally caught on that many of these were 50-70% sugar (!!!) the industry changed their marketing to promote other aspects, and removed the word sugar. Sugar Frosted Flakes became Frosted Flakes. Same thing for \"low salt\" or \"low fat\" or \"includes some vitamin or nutrient\" trends. \n This is good to know if you are in the grocery store, as they still use these tricks. If a product is \"low sugar\", it's probably high in fat and/or salt, and same for \"low fat\" or \"low salt\". Or they will pick a nutrient or vitamin and promote that to hide the high amounts of salt, sugar & fat - for instance Tang was marketed as having lots of Vitamin-C (but was and is really bad for you). \n One of the biggest trends that led to processed food in the past 40 years is summed up by the word \"convenience\". That's been a big part of the food industries marketing tactics, and it's worked. Life has become increasingly busy and complex, and we don't have time to go to work *and* shop for and cook a healthy meal. An aspect of this that I hadn't thought about is the rise of dual-working families - we have gone from 50% of women in the workforce in 1970 to 80% today. Families simply don't have time when both parents work to spend hours cooking when they get home. Thus, \"convenience\", or foods that are easy to buy and make, have risen drastically in that timeframe. \n Emotionally, I could see how this marketing worked on me as a kid. Hearing about products that I used to eat and remembered fondly was kind of sad. Capri Sun, lunchables, hot pockets are just a few such examples mentioned in the book, none of which is particularly good for you. \n The most damning evidence Moss finds is that none of the executives or insiders he talked to eat their own dogfood. In fact, they all have diets that explicitly prohibit it. I think that's very telling. \n Overall, I think book will open your eyes to the \"battlefield\" for space and attention that goes on in the grocery store, and to pay more attention to the labels. That's a big educational process, but one which everyone needs to learn how to do. We need to force the food industry to stop producing foods that are unhealthy by stopping buying them.",

    "review_text": "My wife suggested I read this book, and I resisted for a while as my impression of it somehow was \"not for me\" - but I was wrong! I'm glad she finally convinced me, because it was fun and I couldn't put it down after I got ~20% in. \n Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA, abandons her career as an architect to have kids, hates Seattle, and basically loses it over the course of the book. The book was fun and written a light, humorous tone - from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft, the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves (I loved how she called the other parents \"gnats\"), to how she hires a virtual assistant in India. \n But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is. You really do have to make life fun - it won't do it for you. \n \"That's right,' she told the girls. 'You are bored. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it's boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it's on you to make life interesting, the better off you'll be.\"",

    "review_text": "A wonderful, beautifully written, poignant, subtle, and brilliant novel. \n This is the story of an English butler of one the great houses, whose self value comes from his duty and his dignity, and who questions his values and his life in the end. It is ultimately a story of regret. It is a story that makes you want to live your life and dedicate yourself to things that you won't regret when you look back. One of the best ways of thinking about regret I've ever come across is from Jeff Bezos in his nerdily titled Regret Minimization Framework. \n But what I really loved about the novel is how slow and forcefully it builds. I don't think I've read a book that does that so well since Pride and Prejudice. In the beginning you think it's just a butler going on a motoring trip. And at the end, your heart is breaking. \n Dignity is a big theme in the novel. Stevens attempts to define dignity several times throughout the novel - his definition generally has to do with self-respect and keeping ones emotions in check. But you have to wonder - his is suppression of emotions what leads him to where he ends up? His pushing himself to \"banter\" is a an interesting indication of him trying to break that pattern. \n \"We may now understand better, too, why my father was so fond of the story of the butler who failed to panic on discovering a tiger under the dining table; it was because he knew instinctively that somewhere in this story lay the kernel of what true 'dignity' is.\" \n \"What do you think dignity's all about?' The directness of the inquiry did, I admit, take me rather by surprise. 'It's rather a hard thing to explain in a few words, sir,' I said. 'But I suspect it comes down to not removing one's clothing in public.\" \n In the end, Stevens breaks your heart in two ways: he missed out on the love of his life, AND he realizes that he dedicated his life to serving a man who in the end wasn't the great man he thought he was. Good reminder: prioritize love first. And work on things that matter. \n Another aspect I loved is just learning about the era and how things in England worked. Fascinating for instance that multi-day stays at large estates were the only way to get a bunch of people together to communicate on an issue. Today, we communicate in very different ways. Seems appealing to try that way. \n I'll conclude this with another of my favorite quotes from the novel: \n You've got to enjoy yourself. The evening's the best part of the day. You've done your day's work. Now you can put your feet up and enjoy it. That's how I look at it. Ask anybody, they'll all tell you. The evening's the best part of the day.",

    "review_text": "A thought-provoking book about what makes people succeed. I thought it would be useful as a parent, but it wasn't really focused on children at all - it was more about our education system. \n It was interesting to me that it could be proven that getting a GED had no positive correlation on future success. It was even more interesting that they could correlate adverse childhood experiences to negative adult outcomes. Stress, it turns out, is very harmful especially to younger people. Stress activates a physiological system in our bodies that evolved in order to deal with physical emergencies, but we turn it on for months and years on end, worrying about mortgages, relationships, and other such stuff that comes with a stressful life. It was interesting that the primary way to battle stress in young ones is having a good mother, who hugs/touches her kids a lot. \n A lot of the rest of the book was examining various qualities of successful kids. It seems we are early in our understanding of this issue, but it was interesting learning about all the thinking and experiements that have been done. I think this quote sums up the best thesis of where we are: \n \"The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure,\" Randolph told me. \"And in most highly academic environments in the United States, no one fails anything.\"",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n The conclusion to the epic of Hyperion, and a worthy one at that. I loved this series, and didn't expect I'd find the love story of Aenea and Raul so powerful. \n In two words, this series was about evolution and love. \n The Hyperion story is Yet Another Science Fiction Story About Artificial Intelligence (YASFSAAI) - but it's a damn good one, and more thought out and intricate than any I've ever seen. The Core is split into factions - the TODO - that fight and war amongst themselves, much as humans do. \n The Core evolved from people. Core entities lacked empathy - or the ability to love - and were thus never able to evolve past being a parasite on humanity. The farcaster network was their first parasitic approach, the cruciforms were their second. \n \"Thus evolved some members of the Core---not altruists, but desperate survivalists who realized that the only way ultimately to win their never-ending zero-sum game was to stop the game. And to stop the game they needed to evolve into a species capable of empathy.\" \n It's kind of sad that the Catholic Church is the evil character in the book. But is equally clear that after a great traumatic event like the Fall of the Farcasters, humanity turns to fear and uncertainty, and thus to religion. Unfortunately, the people in charge of that religion are the wrong sort, whose goal is power rather than the good of humanity. \n The curiously named \"Void Which Binds\" is the true all-encompassing force in the universe. It is described in the following quotes: \n \"Aenea heard the music of the spheres. She resonated with the Void Which Binds, which resonates in turn to sentient life and thought, and then she used the almost illimitable energy of the Void to ... to take the first step.\" \n \"That's what writers and artists and creators do, boy. Listen to the Void and try to hear dead folks' thoughts. Feel their pain. The pain of living folks too. Finding a muse is just an artist or holy man's way of getting a foot in the Void Which Binds' front door. Aenea knew that. You should have too.\" \n The one thing I never understood about this series is the Shrike. Why does he exist? In earlier books he's an evil entity. And now we learn something more about his relationship with Colonel Kassad, but not enough to explain his presence or why Aenea is able to rein him in - he almost becomes a good guy. \n The thing I love most about this book, is that the true path, which Aenea is leading humanity on, can only be explained as a love story. Her and Raul's love is a worthy and necessary ending to The Cantos. \n \"To see and feel one's beloved naked for the first time is one of life's pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition.\"",

    "review_text": "I really enjoyed this book. Some people told me that book 3 wasn't the match of books one and two, but I really quite enjoyed it. I'm struggling to put my finger on it, but I think the dynamic of Raul, Aenea, and A Bettik was a strong one - they clearly cared for each other, and you could see that they would even love each other in the future. \n It had all the elements of a great epic: strong heroes on a mission that is important to humanity, an evil empire trying to stop them, and a mysterious force in the universe trying to help them. The world is almost 300 years after the fall of the farcasters, and is described in such a way as to almost be nostalgic. The hawking mat, all the characters and elements of Cantos, the consul's ship, etc. \n One of the major themes of the book seems to be how the universe can be incredibly harsh. This quote captures it nicely: \n \"The universe is indifferent to our fates. This was the crushing burden that the character took with him as he struggled through the surf toward survival or extinction. The universe just does not give a shit.\" \n And I just loved this one: \n \"I remembered Grandam telling me about an early Old Earth scientist, one Charles Darwin, who had come up with one of the early theories of evolution or gravitation or somesuch, and how--although raised a devout Christian even before the reward of the cruciform--he had become an atheist while studying a terrestrial wasp that paralyzed some large species of spider, planted its embryo, and let the spider recover and go about its business until it was time for the hatched wasp larvae to burrow its way out of the living spider's abdomen.\" \n In harsh times, people often turn towards religion. Fascinating to see that after the Fall, after all the chaos and war and death that ensued, it was the Catholic church that rose to power, and goes onto to rule the universe. People are comforted by its ability to make the universe safe for them with the power of the cruciform. \n One of the themes of the book is definitely fear. Fear of death in particular. De Soya fears each death he has, Raul came close to death on Mare Infinitus with the sharks. The Chitchatuk were interesting here - having to live a particularly fearful life, dependent on the thing that eats them for food (artic wraiths). \n But love is the counter to the theme of fear. We keep getting hints that Aenea is the missionary from the human god and will show us all a better path through love. Raul follows her because he believes in her - and it's clearly foreshadowed they will love each other.",

    "review_text": "A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesn't let go. The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can't leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. \n Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. \n The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. \n The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. \n I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. \n I liked Juliet too - she was the right combo of being determined to do right, and having brains and grit.",

A good reminder some of us have it much better than others - but also that human willpower still matters. \n One of the most interesting things portrayed was just how different the rules are for the poor in India. When your family is one bad hospital bill away from being on the streets and starving, human life takes a different value. The story that stuck with me here is when one of the boys got hit by a car on his way to school, his mothers reaction was fury - because if it were any worse it would have bankrupted the family. This quote sums it up well: \n \"It seemed to him that in Annawadi, fortunes derived not just from what people did, or how well they did it, but from the accidents and catastrophes they dodged. A decent life was the train that hadn't hit you, the slumlord you hadn't offended, the malaria you hadn't caught.\" \n Another way the rules are different is that the government is totally corrupt. Pretty hard to get ahead when everyone who can bribe you has got their hand out. \n \"The Indian criminal justice system was a market like garbage, Abdul now understood. Innocence and guilt could be bought and sold like a kilo of polyurethane bags.\" \n But my favorite part of the book was seeing how entrepreneurial people had to be in order to survive. Whether its sorting garbage, being a garbage middleman, or any of the other pursuits various people did to make money, it seemed that at least in one respect the rules of the slum are the same as everywhere else: you've got to work hard and be good at what you do to get ahead. It's just that in the slum, it's so easy to lose it all. Poverty begets poverty, wealth begets wealth.",

    "review_text": "A truly inspirational book by a truly inspirational man. Coach Wooden coached 17 seasons at Indiana and UCLA before winning a championship - and then he won 10 out of the next 12! He is one of the greatest coaches ever, and Reading his book gives some great insights into his philosophy. \n My only criticism of the book is that I think he spent too much time comparing his players, and answering questions like \"who was your greatest player\". I guess he got those questions a lot, but it didn't add much for me. \n One of his top values was conditioning. He thought games were often or largely out of his control as a coach, but what was in his control was how conditioned his team was, and he made a point to have the best conditioned team out there. In fact, he often refused to call timeouts in key situations, banking on his teams conditioning down the stretch. As he said, \"ninety percent of the time the game will be decided in the last 5 minutes\", and of course the better conditioned team will make less mistakes in that time. \n If any one premise typifies my teams in all the years I've coached, it is this concept. Often as a player, I'd tell myself, \"I may play someone better than I am, but I'll never run against one who is going to be in better condition\" And I never played against a man in my life I felt was in better shape, and Lambert often cited me as an example of top conditioning.\" \n Another key aspect of Wooden's philosophy was that he believed the little things, the details, really mattered. Two examples of this: First one was that one of the first things he taught new players was how to properly put their socks and shoes on. It turns out, you can easily do it wrong, which leads to blisters - but kind of amazing to think of him teaching Kareem or Bill Walton how to put their socks on! The second was he really believed in strict discipline and cleanliness - for instance he believed in the team cleaning up a locker room before leaving. These little details would \"establish a spirit of togetherness and consideration that help unite the team into a solid unit.\" \n Wooden believed in focus, and \"playing your game\": \n \"In game play it was always my philosophy that patience would win out. By that, I meant patience to follow our game plan. If we believed in it, we would wear the opposition down and would eventually get to them. If we broke away from our style, however, and played their style, we would be in trouble. And if we let our emotions, rather than our reason, command the game we would not function effectively.\" \n Interestingly, Wooden didn't believe in \"charging teams up on an emotional level\", as many coaches do. In fact, I bet most people that that giving inspirational, charged up speeches is one of the key attributes of a great coach. So this was interesting - and helpful in a lot of ways - people respond more to confidence and having a plan. \n One tactically smart thing Wooden did right before he started winning championships, was to change his practices from having 5 starters vs 5 second team, to 7 or 8 first teamers vs the rest. The first team during practice was literally a rotation between those 7 or 8. This got the key bench players used to playing with the first team, and made a world of a difference. \n But I think my favorite takeaway from the book, was Wooden's philosophy on what to ask of his players. He didn't ask them to win. He asked them to strive to have a \"perfect practice\", or a \"perfect game\". In other words, to play to the very best they can in the given moment. While that may sound obvious, keeping his teams focused on that instead of winning likely made the difference. It's all too easy to start focusing on winning or losing or things that aren't in the moment. \n \"When I was teaching basketball, I urged my players to try their hardest to improve on that very day, to make that practice a masterpiece. \n Too often we get distracted by what is outside our control. You can't do anything about yesterday. The door to the past has been shut and the key thrown away. You can do nothing about tomorrow. It is yet to come. However, tomorrow is in large part determined by what you do today. So make today a masterpiece. You have control over that. \n This rule is even more important in life than basketball. You have to apply yourself each day to become a little better. By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better. Only then will you will be able to approach being the best you can be. It begins by trying to make each day count and knowing you can never make up for a lost day.\" \n ps. I also loved how he had a secret signal with his wife before every game.",

    "review_text": "A hilarious romp through the known and unknown universe that exposes how ridiculous much of US copyright law is. Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. \n The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. \n It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate. \n Overall a fun, enjoyable read.",

    "review_text": "This book has a great premise, and is full of some beautifully written prose. It's about a hacker during the Arab Spring, helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population. Alif falls in love, finds an ancient book, gets into trouble with State, enlists the help of an unseen, magical world full of creatures call Jinn, and combats evil. The story flowed well, and was a fast, fun read. \n I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm a computer programmer, and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of made-up visuals that have nothing to do with hacking. The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didn't know what to make of it. For instance, when Alif is hacking into State's intranet, it is described as: \n \"The Hand roused. It lumbered to its feet, reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones, revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected. He reeled backward, recalibrating. Breaching the confines of the State intranet, the Hand began to attack the base of Alif's tower, slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before.\" \n I didn't know a computer program could \"reek of ionized air\" - and can't conceive of how a mirroring protocol (if there is such a thing) could ever be used to \"slice away layers of code\". \n I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense. But it just didn't. And that was the heart of the story - that the ancient text contained an all-powerful computer algorithm. I also had trouble buying the Alif & Dina relationship - the characters just felt shallow to me.",

    "review_text": "A fun, dark, slightly comical western about two killers (Charlie and Eli Sisters) on their way to California for the gold rush. Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience - I'm not sure I totally enjoyed it. But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing; it was clean, fun, and even poetic - which made this book a quick enjoyable read. \n I loved all the introspective one-liners that Eli kept throwing out. For instance: \n \"but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious.\" \n \"I thought, When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himself--there is a physical, impenetrable separation between him and his fellows.\" \n Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for.\" \n \"It is true, I thought. I am living a life.\" \n \"The effects of her words stung me, and after she stole away I stood a long while before her looking glass, studying my profile, the line I cut in this world of men and ladies.\" \n I struggled however to find the point of this novel. What lesson was I meant to take away? What did we learn from Charlie and Eli's adventure? I suppose if anything the theme of the book was transformation. We witnessed Warm, Morris, and Eli have the courage to transform themselves and change their lives. In other words - it's easy to let life dictate your path. Eli's story of how Charlie sucked him into a life of crime was fascinating. Warm had a similar story of how he became a thief. We didn't learn about Morris's past, but we did see the difficulty of his decision to leave the Commodore's employment. It takes guts to transform oneself - especially for the better.",

    "review_text": "A fascinating story of world war one. I knew the basics, but it was fascinating to hear the story told through some of the characters involved, and see how it all played out. \n On the surface, WW1 was started pretty stupidly. The arch-duke of Austria was assassinated, so in retaliation Austria invaded Serbia. Serbia had an alliance with Russia so they stepped in, and then Germany had an alliance with Austria, so suddenly Germany and Russia were at war. Russia and France had a treaty and since they surrounded Germany, the Germans went on the offensive in France, which dragged in Britain. And then the US got dragged in later by Britain and b/c Germans were sinking our ships. \n But there was more to the story. These countries didn't have to honor these treaties - they could have found a way to not commit to a war. It's almost like they were all war hungry. Follett also tried, through some of the female characters like Maud, to indicate that if the world had been controlled by women then war would never have happened (probably true). This was a great quote: \n \"In every country, those who were against war had been overruled. The Austrians had attacked Serbia when they might have held back; the Russians had mobilized instead of negotiating; the Germans had refused to attend an international conference to settle the issue; the French had been offered the chance to remain neutral and had spurned it; and now the British were about to join in when they might easily have remained on the sidelines.\" \n One issue of the war I hadn't considered was the financial pressures it brought to bear once a country had committed. This was brought up artfully by Ethel's husband Bernie. Once Germany, Britain, etc had declared and spent a ton of money building their army and fighting the war, they were stuck. The people in power - the aristocracy - needed to win or they would go bankrupt and risk losing power. They were pot-committed, and too proud to turn back. \n \"And what if Britain lost? There would be a financial crisis, unemployment, and destitution. Working-class men would take up Ethel's father's cry and say that they had never been allowed to vote for the war. The people's rage against their rulers would be boundless.\" \n My one criticism of the book was that the character Fitz was made out to be a real simpleton. Ethel and Billy seemed to intellectually walk all over him and he never defended himself (or it was left out) - didn't seem terribly realistic. \n I think my favorite part was learning about the Bolshevik revolution - that was a piece of history I really didn't know enough about, and it was described in great detail through Grigory and his story. Czar Nicholas II fell from power during the war, and the Bolsheviks staged a revolution and took over. But its hard to control a country! \n \"A baby was like a revolution, Grigori thought: you could start one, but you could not control how it would turn out.\" \n The class struggles in England, Germany and Russia were clearly a major theme to the book. In each country Follett was careful to show how the aristocracy were fools and didn't know what they were doing. It really highlighted why a democracy is a better way of doing things!",

    "review_text": "This book takes us into the crazy world of North Korea. Imagine a world where the government controls all information and creates a ton of propaganda. There are loudspeakers in every home that tell this propaganda every morning and every evening. Everyone believes their leader is a saint, that the rest of world (especially Americans) are out to get them and could sneak attack at any moment, that South Korea and America are more poor than they are and thus the Dear Leader is sending them food for aid, and on and on. \n The books tells the story of Jun Do, who grows up in an orphanage as the son of the Oprhan Master, and while he claims he's technically not an orphan, it's clear that in effect he is. Orphans are portrayed as lost souls, the bottom of the ladder in society, and always on the search for a father-figure. The first half of the book tells a fairly normal story of Jun Do doing work for his country. \n Jun Do had training to withstand pain, ostensibly in case the South Koreans or Japanese captured him. I found the tidbits mentioned around this very interesting - though not sure how accurate they are. One was to establish a place in your mind with lots of light, and don't leave it, no matter how much pain. The other, which I think sounds useful in general, is more for prisoners or any cooped up, and is summed up in this quote: \n \"Use your imagination only on the future, never on the present or the past.\" \n The second half of the book was completely different from the rest of the story, and it was so out of left field and odd that I didn't enjoy it as much. Jun Do assumes the identity of Commander Ga and gets the most beautiful woman in North Korea to accept him? Really? I didn't really like the story being told from the interrogators point of view either. But I did like learning more about Sun Moon - especially her relationship with the Dear Leader. \n Another criticism is that a lot of the dialogue read like it was people in America chatting. A Korean friend also noticed this - it didn't feel very Korean in many places - and thus didn't feel very authentic. \n But what I loved most about the book was just the glimpse into North Korea. It's amazing how complete a people can be controlled if you can control their information inputs. I loved the part when they visit America and the Americans keep whispering \"You know you lost the war, right?\" - because they knew the North Korean government tells it's citizens they won. \n I wonder if the internet has changed things? There are a few members of Goodreads who put North Korea as their country - but we have zero traffic from that country, so perhaps they are all expats/escapees. \n I'll leave you with my favorite line from the book: \n \"'The next day, she was silent. For breakfast, she murdered an onion and served it raw.\"",

    "review_text": "I loved this book. Although it was a beast of a book, and could probably have been a lot shorter. I had not read a Lincoln biography before, so was firstly blown away by how he rose up from nothing, self-taught himself a college degree, and then somehow rode the middle line and got himself elected President. Nobody seemed to have expected that, nor expected much from him, and he continued to surprise them all. \n I am always curious about the motivations of successful people. In Lincolns case, he just literally seemed to want to have the respect of his peers, and of the American people. \"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition,\" he wrote. \"I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem.\" \n Lincoln's tactic to make his enemies his cabinet was also interesting and ultimately brilliant. Especially because he was so unknown, but also because they were the strongest options, and would be hard for him to manage. The confidence he had was impressive. Lincoln constantly showed this higher level of trust in people that many wouldn't have given because it didn't make themselves look good. Hiring people who are smarter than you, and giving them credit when things go right, is very hard to do. \n But Lincoln could afford to trust his people and even hire people like Chase, who was on his staff yet coveted his job, because he was a masterful tactician. He seemed to have a knack for how to position things to the public at the right times to achieve the right outcomes. The main example of this is of course holding back the proclamation of emancipation so the border states didn't slip into the war on the side of south - but there were many more examples. \n One thing that surprised me was how lax access to the white house and president were back then. You could literally just walk into the White House and get in line to see the President. And he seemed to only have one security guard - who happened to be \"off-duty\" the night he was killed. \n I think Lincolns main strength was his empathy. He spent a lot of time trying to understand the people of different states, and putting himself in their shoes and imagining how they felt given what they knew about the situation. A tough, tough thing to do as his whole presidency was during a civil war during which over 600,000 soldiers died. I can't imagine having that on your conscience and trying to internalize that. But a very valuable skill to have as a leader. \n \"Lincoln had internalized the pain of those around him--the wounded soldiers, the captured prisoners, the defeated Southerners. Little wonder that he was overwhelmed at times by a profound sadness that even his own resilient temperament could not dispel.\"",

    "review_text": "This is a fascinating glimpse into American history, of which I was largely ignorant - well worth a read. I had no idea prohibition lasted 14 years! My only criticism is the author spent way too much time on the politics of prohibition - that could have been cut by half. \n The bottom line of prohibition is that is was a massive failure. It singlehandedly created organized crime, cost the government lots of money in lost taxes and enforcement, and failed to stop pretty much anyone from drinking. \n It did have some upside though. Americans had a drinking problem and definitely drank less overall during prohibition, and even afterwards. But more importantly prohibition helped transform American culture. Prohibition coincided with massive immigration and population growth, which all happened in the cities. It was really a battle between urban culture and rural culture. It particularly didn't make sense in urban culture, and people rebelled, giving us \"the roaring 20's\". Prohibition helped us go from a stay at home culture to one where it was acceptable to go out and consume liquor. \n Prohibition gave us income tax. The Anti-Saloon League (ASL), which was the organization that pushed prohibition through, pushed income tax through first because the government couldn't approve prohibition without finding an alternate source of revenue for the massive amount of tax money (30% of federal revenue) it made on liquor. \n Many businesses got their starts in prohibition. Walgreens went from 20 to 525 stores during prohibition, because of the legal loophole that medicinal liquor was allowed, so drugstores were a major source of liquor sales. Coca Cola saw sales triple. The entire ecosystem of Nassau and the Bahamas was created. Sam Bronfman, the largest bootlegger in Canada, turned his operation into a legitimate business afterwards, owning many major liquor brands under the Seagrams brand. \n The major failing of prohibition, and the reason it was eventually repealed, was the organized crime. Al Capone was the poster boy, but all the major mafia families got their start bootlegging, then got organized, then went on to bigger and better criminal activities. Yes it gave us Las Vegas, but it wasn't a good thing. If anything, this is the argument for the legalization of Marijuana (though there are other factors there). \n In the end I think that prohibition was a bad idea because it was the government trying to tell Americans how to live. Individuals have to take responsibility for themselves.",

Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. \n One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. \n I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. \n One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.",

    "review_text": "This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. \n The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful. He believed that computers were \"at the intersection of technology and liberal arts\" - a phrase he used a lot - because he realized computers weren't just for geeks. They are for everyone, and needed to be able to be used by everyone. \n Steve put design at the top of product pyramid at Apple - above engineering. This means they spent a lot of time trying to fit the hardware into the beautifully designed cases the designers came up with, and the designers and engineers had to work together closely. This can backfire (eg Antennagate), but largely it worked really well. It produced amazing computers that were visually distinct from everything else in the market, and that \"just work\". If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it. \n Apple's design philosophy is to \"make it simple. Really simple\". You still see this today - go to Apple.com - you will see ONE product. Now try Amazon. According to the book, Jobs learned this from Markkula, who taught him that \"A great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it makes\". \n Steve's ethos was basically that if you are going to do something, do it right. The book is full of examples of Steve doing this. When the iMac first came out it looked like no other computer. It was interesting to hear how difficult it was for the engineers to accommodate a handle on the computer - but it ended up being a defining feature of the computer. I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores. \n Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like \"jerk\" to describe him. It sounds like Steve could definitely be a jerk to work for. His management style was to push people as hard as he could, and to let people know when they didn't perform. When pushed like that, a person can have one of two reactions: they either resent it, and end up quitting or getting fired (B-players) - or they accept the challenge to do better, and come back the next week with something even better. Win-win for Steve - he filters out the b-players and gets his a-players to produce the best work they can. \n But, as was pointed out in the book, if Steve was nothing but a jerk, he wouldn't have built a company full of loyal employees - Apple has one of the lowest turnover rates in the valley. Jobs only hired people who \"had a passion for the product\". I also liked how he motivated by looking at the bigger picture; such as the story of how he convinced his engineer that saving 10 seconds off the boot time was worth it because across 5 million users that would save 100 lifetimes per year. \n The book was full of references to Steve's dynamic personality; his \"reality distortion field\" is a great descriptor. Steve believed he could do anything - and he was so persuasive that he could convince those around him that they could whatever it was too. I think this is one of the most defining qualities of an entrepreneur - believing something can be done against all odds. Not being afraid to tear down walls or think outside the box. \n I loved the description of Steve that \"whatever he was touting was the best thing he ever produced.\" You see him do this in his keynote speeches too. He is always using words like \"best\", \"amazing\", etc to describe whatever he's launching. \n A big theme that the author made was that especially early on, Steve viewed Apple as \"counter-culture\" rebels. They were hippies who thought they could change the world. And they did - but not only that - I think they embedded their can-do attitude deep in Silicon Valley, which is probably highly correlated with why it is the center of the technology revolution today. This quote is classic: \n \"The people who invited the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently. The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence.\" \n One of Steve's great abilities was to focus. When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential. \n \"What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they're dragging you down. They're turning you into Microsoft. They're causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great.\" \n Steve's belief that computers need to be beautiful and easy to use basically prevented him from ever licensing his software, as then he wouldn't be able to control the user experience. Microsoft didn't have that problem, and that's why Windows dominated. I think it's also the reason that Windows is in trouble today. They have spent a decade making their code work across hundreds of different hardware configurations. Their code is now full of backwards compatibility support that just makes it messy, and bloated. Worse, their focus is on maintaining all that instead of innovating and improving it. \n The platform vs integrated approach is being tested again with the iphone vs android. It will be interesting to see if history replays itself, or if Apple's lead and ability to make a superior product because of their full stack control will prevail. \n In the end, this was the best quote of the book: \n Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.",

    "review_text": "A hilarious and book from Tina Fey - definitely worth listening to over audio as she reads it herself. She makes fun of herself a lot, adds lots of light humor, and of course shares TMI. \n The most interesting bit was hearing the behind the scenes of Saturday Night Live, and how she was a joke writer there for 3 years before they gave her a role on the show, which was only doing the news. Her breakout occurred after she had already left for 30 Rock, when she did the Sarah Palin impersonation. Tina is clearly an example of someone who has worked long and hard to get where she is.",

In fact, pretty much every major character is in danger of dying and some even do. It's a bit tough to read, as you really wanted The King In The North to succeed. And Dany is fast becoming an interesting part of the plot that has yet to intermix with the rest of the characters. \n I'll be starting the next one soon. These books are like crack.",

    "review_text": "I first read this ~10 years ago and just re-read it as someone reminded me that it predicts the future of reading. And it does - what I love about Stephenson is his high level of prescient-ness. In fact I think it also predicts a lot of the future of nanotechnology and entertainment. \n The Young Ladies Illustrated Primer is a dynamic book with an AI in it. Imagine Alexa or Siri in 5-10 years, smart enough to make up stories on the fly and answer questions about or even redirect the storyline. The YLIP is designed in the book for a 4 year old girl, Fiona, but Nell and a few other girls end up with them also. Maybe this resonated with me as I have a 4 year old girl and wish this existed for her. What's particularly powerful about this, is the story was able to be adaptive to the problems in Nell's life, and give her strength and confidence at moments when she needed it. Some cool trivia: Project Fiona was the codename for the Kindle. There is now a building at Amazon in Seattle named Fiona. \n One of the pieces of magic of the Young Ladies Illustrated Primer was that for Nell and Fiona's editions, there were live actors (\"ractors\") on the other end, reading all the lines 1 on 1. This put a level of personalization and human connection into the story for the girls that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. Learning about the marketplace of ractors was particularly interesting and it's hard to think such a thing won't exist in 2-5 years as VR takes off. Would you rather watch the movie Harry Potter or live act out the scenes with 2 friends as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and have professional actors play the other characters? You can imagine this being a big form of entertainment of the future. \n The nanotechnology described in the book was also fascinating. Describing a world of robots and drones too small for the human eye to see, doing tasks and even fighting each other. Massive wars we perceive as \"particularly dusty days\". Poisoning or taking control of another person is as easy as getting them to inhale or injest some nanobots. The drummers were a particularly interesting notion of hive-mind, connecting multiple humans together through nanobots attached to their synapses on their brain. And then of course you have nanobots creating other bots, which led to this great quote: \n \"The Victorian system used Darwinian techniques to create killers adapted to their prey, which was elegant and effective but led to the creation of killers that were simply too bizarre to have been thought up by humans, just as humans designing a world never would have thought up the naked mole rat.\" \n But of course the biggest implication of nanotechnology is the ability to manipulate molecules and thus - given The Feed (which I somehow provides a stream of molecules & energy for manipulation) - you can make anything in a Matter Compiler (MC). This is kind of like what they had in Star Trek, and what 3D printing gives us .0001% of today. \n The book is largely about what would happen to society if MC's were invented and much of the need for farming, manufacturing, etc was eliminated. Poverty would become even more prevalent, as would crime, governments would collapse, and of course, a class divide would emerge as never before, driven by those who have technology and those who don't. And of course, badass engineers like Hackworth will rule the day (kind of). I suppose in a way the book is about the fear of what will happen if technology progresses too far and leaves masses of humans without a purpose in life. Parking lots and chaos. \n \"These were rice paddies before they were parking lots. Rice was the basis for our society. Peasants planted the seeds and had highest status in the Confucian hierarchy. As the Master said, \"Let the producers be many and the consumers few.' When the Feed came in from Atlantis, from Nippon, we no longer had to plant, because the rice now came from the matter compiler. It was the destruction of our society. When our society was based upon planting, it could truly be said, as the Master did, \"Virtue is the root; wealth is the result.' But under the Western ti, wealth comes not from virtue but from cleverness. So the filial relationships became deranged. Chaos,\" Dr. X said regretfully, then looked up from his tea and nodded out the window. \"Parking lots and chaos.\"",

    "review_text": "Great story of the US Ambassador to Germany and his experience during the build-up of ww2 from 1933 - 1937. Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. \n Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. \n I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. \n I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.",

    "review_text": "Great story about the founding of Microsoft from it's cofounder Paul Allen. I've read a few books about Microsofts history before (such as Gates), but it was fascinating to hear it from the horses mouth. \n What stuck out for me was that Paul and Bill were on the cutting edge of software ever since they first saw a computer as teenagers. Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers mentioned the fact that having access to a computer at that time was a huge advantage, and Paul's story confirms that. The world only changes massively so many times, and the age of computing has certainly been one of them - and Paul and Bill were in the right place, at the right time, and with the right drive to succeed. \n What was impressive was how Paul and Bill executed like crazy. They had the edge, and they worked really hard, long hours to keep it. It was sad that Paul burned out so early - but also understandable given that Bill had such a strong personality. \n Paul prides himself on being a forward thinker. He gives multiple stories of always following the latest technology and trying to look forward and think about what is coming next. Indeed, it's that trait that led to Microsoft being formed as they were certainly at the forefront of the software revolution. In one part of the book Paul even predicts that Mobile is the next big platform and that the PC is dying. \n I've always worked at startups, which tend to innovate more than they follow. So it was interesting to hear Allen talking about how Microsoft's strategy went from being on the cutting edge of technology in it's infancy to being a 400 pound gorilla that used a approach of copying innovative products and using it's cash reserves and muscle to out-execute on an idea. I suppose this is what a big company has to do - but it's a hard position to win from. An Microsoft really hasn't had a lot of wins lately. They haven't innovated enough on Hotmail. Bing is nice but not better than Google in any significant ways. And even the high and mighty Internet Explorer is really losing ground to Chrome/Firefox/Safari. Paul is right - you have to look to what is ahead. \n Since Microsoft, Paul has certainly stayed busy: owning sports teams, investing in lots of different companies, building a space program, and touring around on his 400 foot yacht. Most of his investments have been in the vein of improving technology and trying to predict the next big things, especially in his particular interests. \n I think his brain mapping project and the Digital Aristotle projects stand out - they sound really interesting and important. The appendix lists a few of the current challenges issues with getting a computer to understand human language, which was fascinating. Allen even alludes to the oft-mentioned Singularity, but says that he doesn't think it will occur in our lifetimes, as despite Moore's law advancing computing power fast enough, we are lightyears away with AI. \n Some useful tidbits: \n - p65 Even Bill Gates wasn't the best at Math in college at Harvard. There are all kinds of smarts! \n - Lesson: decentralize or don't distract the ceo: http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/... \n - It was interesting that Allen said that his biggest mistakes were not finding the right people to help him execute his visions. It's all about people. \n Update: my interview with Paul Allen is now live!",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n A very well written series of short stories. There was no \"main\" character, though I was curious and counted and out of 13 chapters, Sasha was in 5 and and Bennie Salazar was in 4. The story wove and dipped in and out of their lives, and occasionally into surrounding characters. I thought it was a little hard to keep track of all the stories and how they related, though. \n I think Lou was one of my favorite characters. Lou is a stereotypical record producer and ladies man. I loved how he at one point was quoted as saying \"I'll never get old\", and then there was a whole chapter later dedicated to his death. Lou is one of those guys that is immediately likable, even though you know he's probably not a great role model: \"The world is full of shitheads, Rhea. Don't listen to them--listen to me. And I know that Lou is one of those shitheads. But I listen.\" \n If this book has a theme I think it's something to do with how people change as they get older. \"Time is a goon\" was quoted in two different chapters, and if it means \"goon\" as in a thug, then the implication is that time \"beats us up' - or changes us - as our lives go on. We remain the same people underneath, but we are defined by the experiences we have, and the more time we live the more life shapes us into totally different people. \n In the last chapter I loved the concept of the parrots - or people who sell out and endorse a product to create \"authentic\" word of mouth. As someone who is building a social network I think this is an interesting perspective, and one that I think is definitely a trend. It's nothing even new - celebrities have been selling out and taking money to endorse products for a long time. \n But what is new is that celebrities aren't the only ones with followings anymore. Now with Facebook and Twitter and other social networks (yes, even Goodreads), regular people can amass hundreds and even thousands of friends. And maybe instead of paying one celebrity with 100K followers to promote something you pay 100 people with 1K followers. Indeed this is already starting - some friends of mine helped start Ad.ly - which lets you buy celebrities tweets.",

    "review_text": "A very interesting book about John Boyd, who was a crack fighter pilot, and then later military strategist and reformer. Boyd flew as an instructor in the real life version of Top Gun, and beat everyone in 40 seconds or less. But later in his life he really studied military strategy, and this is where the interesting parts of this book are. \n Boyd was literally the designer of the F-15, and a theory of maneuvering called Energy-Manueverability (E-M), which mathematically gave a chart for each aircraft that gave pilots an idea of the ideal speeds and altitudes they could use to pull off various turns and tactics. \n One interesting thing I noted was that throughout his career, like everyone else in the military, Boyd was getting reviewed by his superiors, called ER's. It was interesting to hear, and relevant to business, how you had to \"read through the lines\" and how even a positive sounding ER could be a career-killer if the person wasn't recommended for promotion. Reading this has definitely made me think twice every time I've read (or written) recommendations for people. \n Another Boyd tidbit I liked was when fighting bureaucratic battles in the Pentagon, he had a mantra to \"use the other persons information against him\". Starting with the other persons argument and data, and working backwards, you can make pretty compelling arguments. \n Perhaps the biggest idea Boyd came up with is what is called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. A key quote defining the OODA loop: \n \"Thinking about operating at a quicker tempo - not just moving faster - than the adversary was a new concept in waging war. Generating a rapidly changing environment - that is, engaging in activity that is quick it is disorienting and appears uncertain or ambiguous to the enemy - inhibits the adversary's ability to adapt and causes confusion and disorder that, in turn, causes an adversary to overreact or underreact. Boyd closed the briefing by saying the message is that whoever can handle the quickest rate of change is the one who survives.\" \n Another great quote that helps explain it: \n \"Boyd said the strategies and bloodbaths of World War 1 were the natural consequence of both the vo Clausewitzian battle philosophy and the inability of generals to adapt new tactics to nineteenth-century technology: line abreast, mass against mass, and linear defenses against machine guns and quick-firing artillery. The bankrupt nature of that doctrine was demonstrated on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, which the British suffered sixty thousand casualties. After more than three years of the meat-grinding form of war, the Germans began engagements with a brief artillery barrage with smoke and gas obscuring their intentions, then sent in a special infantry teams. These small groups looked for gaps in the defense and advanced along many paths. They did not hit strong points but instead went around them, pressing on, always going forward and not worrying about their flanks. They were like water going downhill, bypassing obstacles, always moving, proving, and then, when they found an opening, pouring through, pressing deeper and deeper.\" \n Getting your lieutenants to the point where they can do this kind of infiltration successfully requires great communication and men who can think fast on their feet. In other words, you had to enable every leader to be able to follow the OODA loop, and just arm them with the overal goals, and trust them to make their own decisions. Very different from previous military structures, where \"the need to know\" remained at the top. \n Why is this empowerment valuable? Because: \n \"The key thing to understand about Boyd's version is the not the mechanical cycle itself, but rather the need to execute the cycle in such fashion as to get inside the mind and the decision cycle of the adversary. This means the adversary is dealing with out-dated or irrelevant information and thus becomes confused and disoriented and can't function.\" \n And: \n \"Understanding the OODA loop enables a commander to compress time - that is, the time between observing a situation and taking an action. A commander can use the temporal discrepancy (a form of fast transient) to select the least-expected action rather than what is predicted to be the most effective action. The enemy can also figure out what might be the most effective. To take the least-expected action disorients the enemy. It causes him to pause, wonder, to question.\" \n This makes sense. You can almost picture the commanders of old, who used to have to get on the phone with their boss in order make any decision. \"Take the bridge, blow it up, or wait?\". Hours and days could be spent waiting around for generals to make up their minds. This form of maneuver warfare is what the Germans used in WWII - they called it blitzkrieg - and it's what we used in Iraq the first time. \n In business we have a word for the above - micromanagement. In a sense, it sounds like empowering business leaders and their lieutenants to have an effective OODA loop is what will let a business move faster and win marketshare. I bet somebody has written a book about that - I will have to look.",

    "review_text": "I learned two major things from this book: the power of branding, and the fact that Richard Branson has balls of solid steel. \n Branson is one of the great entrepreneurs of our era, and it was truly inspiring to hear his story in his own words. A kid who skipped college and dove straight into business, and time and time again proved he can succeed with a lot of will, determination, and his maverick ability to take big bets and win. Bransons' success is nothing short of inspirational. \n I had no idea until reading this how powerful the Virgin brand is, or how many businesses they have gone into. They effectively function like a VC, except they also lend their brand (and perhaps some infrastructure too). Each business is a subsidiary, given its leaders the freedom to move fast and achieve their goals without being slown down by needing permission from the mother ship. This is brilliant. Many of the businesses also complement each other in profitable ways - such as how Virgin Travel and Virgin Atlantic complemented each other. \n Branson is a risk-taker. When Virgin Records was about to run out of cash, instead of scraping what he had left to limp on, he scraped it together to make a big bet. It's kind of like going all-in in poker when your chips are getting low - better than losing slowly! \n \"I have always believed that the only way to cope with a cash crisis is not to contract but to try to expand out of it.\" \n But the difference with Branson is that he didn't take the risks blindly. When he started the airlines he spent considerable effort leasing the airline for 1 year and limiting his downside. \n It is only by being bold that you get anywhere. If you are a risk-taker, then the art is to protect the downside.\" \n One thing I loved about Branson, is he was not afraid to bluff. This was first illustrated early in the book when, learning about a plot to force him out of Student, he acted pre-emptively and told the leader that he had already switched the teams mind - when instead he had no idea how far along the plot actually was. We see this time and time again - Branson is able to divine where things are going, and negotiate on points he isn't even wholly sure about. \n Branson detailed a lot of his crazy ballooning adventures, which I wasn't so into. I wanted to hear how he built Virgin. Although I did appreciate that his passion for ballooning did lead to several advances in airplane technology. \n The end of the book went into a lot of detail of how Branson is giving back to the world - which I respect a lot - any billionaire worth their salt should do that, but it was great to see him embrace the challenges with the same zeal he embrace business. From climate change to Virgin Fuel to Virgin Galactic, Branson is thinking hard about our planet and where its going and how to get us there. And of course, if Virgin Fuel does well it will only help his airline business - so not a bad bet.",

    "review_text": "Just heard a talk by Chip which was very inspirational. He talked a lot about Abraham H. Maslow's hierarchy, and how it can be applied to employees, customers, and investors. Employee pyramid is: salary => recognition => calling. I thought his principles were similar to Tony Hsieh's book Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose. He even mentioned this was true, and that Tony and 10 other companies that had great culture had all studied Maslow (Apple, Southwest, Google, Whole Foods, Zappos, etc). \n The top of any pyramid is hard for most business leaders because it's the self-actualization - the intangible stuff, which can't be measured. And most business leaders are taught to run things by the numbers. Told a story to illustrate this about why Southwest doesn't charge fees for checking baggage. It's because they didn't want to make their flight attendants into baggage handlers - which is what happens on other airlines, where everyone tries to carry everything on to save money. Southwest flight attendants are happier than other airlines, and this leads to less employee turnover and higher customer retention. Which saves them money in the long run - it's just impossible to measure. He also noted that the hospital industry did an extensive survey of what the top hospitals in the nation had in common. The results: the nurses were happier and more involved in each one. \n Looking forward to the actual book, of which I now have a copy!",

    "review_text": "The Name of the Rose is a thrilling Dan Brown-esque murder mystery set in a 14th century Italian monastery. It really is two stories - the story of the murder mystery, and that of political climate in Italy at the time. And of course, they nicely interweave throughout. \n The history the book brought was one of my favorite parts. I learned about how the church controlled so much of the world, how even then it was already starting to fall from power, why saints are so prevalent in Italy, and more. I learned about Franciscans and Dolcians and minorites, and poverity and false monks. Poverty was a big theme, which came through on several levels: rebellions by poor people and religious leaders stepping in to lead the masses, and also an a debate about the role the Church should have in society. \n I loved brother William of baskerville. He was Sherlock Holmes-esque (so that can't be a coincidence he's from Baskerville right?) in his deductive reasoning and approach. I think my favorite moment of his was when he had no time left to solve the crime he said \"when a man has little time, he must take care to maintain his calm. We must act as if we had eternity before us.\" \n I took one star off because I often found myself skipping large sections that went into flowery details of something (often history) that just seemed irrelevant. \n The book was also a lot about change. The monks were so set in their ways and in their dogma that you could see how it likely took generations before a viewpoint could really change. The focus on humor for instance and the dogmatic viewpoint of Jorge was in my opinion simply nothing more than fear of change. We all know that the introduction of humor and the divine comedy didn't ruin the world. \n The library was one of the greatest in the world at the time. I would love to have seen it. Yet it was almost impossible to access, and that very lack of accessibility is what ultimately led to it's destruction. Seems like the message is that knowledge should be open and free and and keeping it locked up can be more dangerous than not.",

    "review_text": "An extremely well-written account of the 2008 financial collapse. It explained complex ideas like subprime mortgage bonds and CDO's in a clear way, and almost read like a fast paced thriller. \n Essentially it seems that a bad ratings system and human greed created an economy that fostered the creation of a lot of bad debts, that eventually went bad, and caused a lot of big companies to go under (Lehman brothers, Bear Sterns), or require a bailout (Goldman Sachs, AIG). This is the real crime. These big companies were so focused on short term profits that they failed to see that long term what they were doing wasn't going to work. They should be appropriately punished for this, and instead many of them were saved by Uncle Sam. Would we have had a worse recession if Obama hadn't done that? Maybe. Maybe not. Lewis should write another book about that :) \n Let me see if I can get this right. The book explains that mortgages are sold by the banks that issue them, passing off the risk. Mortgages are aggregated into groups in mortgage bonds, which are then packaged into tranches, which are rated by agencies such as Moody's and S&P's. The math was complex, but apparently somehow tranches that consisted almost entirely of \"subprime\" (aka risky) mortgages were being given high A ratings. I guess the theory was that by spreading out the risk across lots of mortgage bonds it lowered the risk. Too bad this didn't work. \n Many of these mortgages were the variety that started 2 year fixed then went floating. They were largely taken out in 2005 - 2006, and as they hit 2 years the interest rates jumped as they went floating, and hoards of people defaulted. This explains why we teetered in 2007 and crashed in 2008. One of my favorite quotes to illustrate the madness: \n \"In Bakersfield, California, a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house for $724,000.\" \n And it wasn't just in Bakersfield. All over the country people were taking out loans that were too big for their britches, because the banks were encouraging it: \n \"The simple measure of sanity in housing prices, Zelman argued, was the ratio of median home price to income. Historically, in the United States, it ran around 3:1; by late 2004, it had risen nationally, to 4:1. \"All these people were saying it was nearly as high in some other countries,\" says Zelman. \"But the problem wasn't just that it was four to one. In Los Angeles it was ten to one and in Miami, eight-point-five to one.\" \n Economics is about incentives, and this book explained how they went very awry. But it was also a story about greed, and how even unintelligent people made a lot of money by riding the subprime mortgage train. The book followed several investors who noticed what was happening, but when they tried to tell people and test their \"crazy\" hypothesis that the financial world was going to collapse, they were mocked or ignored. So they just ended up shorting (betting against) the whole thing to make some money, which is what a good investor does. \n \"What are the odds that people will make smart decisions about money if they don't need to make smart decisions--if they can get rich making dumb decisions?\" \n I think the lesson in the end is that if it looks to good to be true, it is. That, and we need smarter people working at the ratings agencies.",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n An interesting book in terms of it's structure: 5 distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways, then wind back out. This way of doing the structure was unique, and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together. But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary. \n I generally don't try to summarize novels in my reviews, but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful. \n Story 1: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose). Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of. \n Story 2: Robert Frobisher. Perhaps my favorite story - about a penniless young musician who as a last-ditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician, Vyvyan Ayrs. The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA's wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. \n Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. \n Story 4: Timothy Cavendish. Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit, then the author's mafia-esque family get's on his case and he's on the run. He lands in a old-persons home/prison. This story is kind of a nightmare, and is revealed to be a movie in the next story. \n Story 5: Somni 451. One of favorites, for how different it was. Set in the far future in an asian country, humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves. This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs - but our protagonist, Somni, breaks through and becomes self-conscious. The scary thing is I can easily see this happening! Told as recollections in an interview. \n Story 6: Sloosha's Crossin'. Story of Zach'ry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii. Somni is now their deity. Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes. \n All six stories were very graphic and real, and had extremely good character development. Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I can't describe here. \n I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book. Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it, the major theme was freedom and slavery. Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain, Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys, Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians, Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home, Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom, and Zach'ry's people were captured and enslaved. All the stories touched on various ways people can \"enslave\" and control other people for various reasons. \n I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings, but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves. Sounds good anyways, so I'll stick with that - but am interested to hear what other people thought.",

    "review_text": "This is a book that every entrepreneur definitely needs to read, and everyone who works even remotely with Facebook needs to read. It does a simply amazing job going behind the scenes of Facebook and describing where the site came from, how it got to where it is, and where it's going. \n The author had amazing inside access to Mark Zuckerberg and other key Facebook employees and investors. Very smart of Facebook to include David so often - it makes their story fully open, which is consistent with the values of their company - not to mention good PR. \n The biggest takeaway I had was that Zuckerberg actually has much more of a vision and philosophy than I gave him credit for. The basic vision for Facebook is that it's a communication tool. It's very interesting to see that they think of it as a utility tool and not a media destination (like MySpace no doubt does). It means they are not afraid of sending traffic away from their site as long as they provide value up front - something that has been crucial to their success. \n Zuckerbergs philosophy however is more interesting - he believes being open is better and will lead to a better society. He thinks the internet will inevitably enable this anyways, so Facebook might as well lead the charge. It's an interesting and idealistic philosophy - basically that it's really hard for a person to be dishonest or immoral in any way if their whole life is laid open to their friends. In fact, one has to strive to be an even better person, because everything we do is not being tracked and if it isn't already online, it will be soon. The books we read, the things we buy, the people we date, the places we go, the people we associate with - all this is online, and defines who we are. Would my future children be proud of me if they examined my life's consumption? If I knew they were going to do so, would I make better choices? Absolutely. \n However the privacy road has rocked many people's worlds who haven't gotten the hint yet and EVERYTHING you put online, whether on Facebook or a seeming private place elsewhere, is ultimately public. The chapter on privacy listed many of these horror stories, and I certainly know more than a few stories of people who have been burned by having an inappropriate photo on Facebook or tweeting something inappropriate. The road to openness is happening - and I think Mark is right that it's going to make us better as a society. The danger, however, is that it will still cause many people a lot of pain as we get there - and may cause many to ultimately retreat from Social Networking (and the internet). I think Mark knows his responsibility there as his service depends on it, and I hope he's a good steward, as this is certainly a topic we debate a lot at Goodreads. \n I worked in Social Networking during the Rise of Facebook - my company, Tickle, is even mentioned a few times in the book. This book made the mistakes we made at Tickle even more apparent. Hindsight is a ...! For instance, starting with colleges that were *private* was what really worked - everyone had no problems sharing everything with their fellow classmates and alums. \n Facebook's biggest product innovation though was of course Platform. Followed perhaps by the Like button and Facebook Connect - which are really only possible because so many people use Facebook. Both were big wins, and were interesting pushed hard by Zuckerberg, and their success really validated him as a leader internally. \n One interesting note that I hadn't considered was that because everyone uses their real names on Facebook, blogs that use Facebook Connect for comments (eg Huffington Post) don't have the troll problem as much, because of the openness issue (see above). \n The book was also very interesting as it gave a lot of the details of how Facebook was financed, how the VC deals were structured, what sort of offers it got, etc. Zuckerberg was courted to sell by so many large companies, I had always wondered how he had the nerve to say no - most in his shoes would have sold out for millions or billions long ago. The answer seems to be that he doesn't really value money, and also that he knows this is his big Life's Opportunity to change the world - and to sell now would be to squander it. \n The book also gave interesting insight into where Facebook thinks they are going. In the future they think they will be less of a destination site, and more of a social communication enabler. Everything that can be social will be, and it will be done with Facebook. Every website you visit, your TV, video games, and perhaps even your cereal box will one day have Facebook Connect.",

    "review_text": "Tony Hsieh has some nerve suggesting that he built a billion dollar company in pursuit of happiness. But the surprising thing is I actually think he's onto something. Something that cuts through a lot of corporate BS and really makes sense. \n Tony's thesis is basically that, whatever our intermediate goals in life are (get your dream job, make a lot of money, find the right girl, etc), our ultimate goal is simply to be happy. And what's more, (this is the key), happiness in life has to come from your job as much as your personal life. \n Tony lays out a framework for how he personally has used happiness to create a very unique and successful culture at Zappos - and how he personally came to that conclusion in his own life. \n I heard Tony Hsieh speak several years ago, and from that had one key takeaway: that instead of spending marketing dollars acquiring customers, just have mind-blowing WOWingly good customer service - and your product will spread naturally - as people will tell their friends about their good experiences. It's harder to calculate the ROI, but it's something that makes a lot of sense, and we've definitely incorporated it into Goodreads. \n Tony's Happiness frameworks has four pieces: \n 1. Perceived control: people need to be in control over their own fate. At Zappos reps can earn up to 20 different skill sets or \"badges\", and each one represents a pay raise. It's up to the employee how much money they want to make. \n 2. Perceived progress: nobody likes to feel like they aren't going anywhere. At Zappos they give smaller raises every 6 months instead of bigger ones annually. \n 3. Connectedness. Studies show that engaged employees are more productive, and the number of good friends an employee has at work is correlated with how engaged the employee is. I found this one most interesting. \n 4. Vision/Meaning/High Purpose. People need to believe in something bigger than themselves. The book Good to Great discusses how the truly great companies in terms of long term financial performance are those with higher purposes beyond making money. This I do believe, which is why on the Goodreads about us page our mission is stated as \"to get people excited about reading\". \n Other things I learned about Tony that were interesting: \n - Tony walked away from $20 million dollars because he didn't want to waste a year being miserable working for Microsoft. \n - Tony spent every cent he made from the $265 million LinkExchange acquisition in keeping Zappos afloat. Again - admirable. \n Things I learned about Zappos that were interesting: \n - The Zappos Core Values actually help the company quite a lot, as they've made believing in their core values a core value. \n - The Core values are the way to keep the culture strong, because they are guidelines for people hiring to keep the desired qualities and traits. Each core value has different interview questions, and employees try to gauge new candidates on each value using these questions. \n - Zappos believes so much in it's culture that Tony created a program to teach other companies how it did it - called Zappos Insights. \n - Zappos built a culture book filled with stories of employees describing what each of the core values means to them regarding the company. This makes the company feel like a big family.",

    "review_text": "I was pleased, but not satisfied to have read this book. In truth - it was too short! This is a great primer, but I hope someone can convince David Sokol to do a more in depth version, as I think there is a lot more we can learn from him. \n It kind of felt like I was getting macro board-level type coaching on the philosophy of how to create and manage a successful business. I saw the same themes popping up that I see in other places, such as Tony Hsieh's new Delivering Happiness book, Four Steps to the Epiphany, and even the lean startup. Clearly all businesses have parallels in terms of the best ways to run them - and equally clearly David Sokol knows his stuff. \n My Notes \n Chapter II: Core Principles \n * Customer commitment: Sokol believes a business should have a core principle to put the customer first. This is a theme I've heard from a number of CEO's of respected companies, and one I truly believe in. Make sure to remember that anyone your business deals with is a customer - that includes not just consumers, but also suppliers, partners, etc. \n * Employee commitment: also a core value focus to provide the best workplace possible. Don't hire employees unless the existing team is already operating at 125% capacity - it isn't fair to hire people then have to lay them off later. Keep a notebook on each direct report's successes/failures each month. Communicate constantly to ensure each report knows if they are meeting expectations. Rank employees. \n * Financial Strength: often not given enough everyday focus. Must have ever-vigilant focus on margins, balance sheet, and avoiding future risks. \n * Integrity: (I'm comforted that this is a core value). When hiring he looks for integrity, intellect, and passion. Enron, Worldcom and Tyco failed because of a lack of integrity at the highest level. Warren Buffet uses the question \"Would I be comfortable for my action to be disclosed in a front page story on my hometown paper, written by a knowledgeable and thorough reporter and read by all my friends and family?\" \n Chapter III: Goal Setting and Budgeting \n * Do a 10 year plan once a year. The plan won't be useful for more than a few years, but it's a good exercise to think at a macro level. \n * \"It is the discipline of setting goals, coupled with consistent fact based measurement, that creates great outcomes in business or in personal life\". \n * Set goals annually and measure them monthly. Get the whole team doing this. \n Chapter IV: Plan, Execute, Measure, and Correct \n * Plans are often under-described. Each detail must be described, along with how it will be measured. \n * Plans often, and by necessity, include assumptions. It is critical these assumptions be documented as such, the risks clearly described, so that they can be measured and verified later. Assumptions must be verified! \n * \"Verifying that a plan is being executed properly and that all activities are on budget and on schedule is not micromanaging, it is MANAGING.\"",

    "review_text": "It was nice to be back in Africa, even for a short time. This was a beautifully written memoir, and a remarkable glimpse into what Africa was like a century ago. I fear the Africa Dinesen described is long gone. \n I picked this up tainted by having seen the movie first, and was kind of glad and surprised at the differences. The fact that she almost doesn't even mention her husband, who was so prominent in the film, I think would have been strange even to those who hadn't seen the movie. Also the way she described her romances was so proper one wasn't sure for some time if they were friends or something more. \n The language used to describe the culture in the early 1900's, and the relationship between the Natives and the Europeans, was very interesting. At times you'd read over sentences that just wouldn't fly today, and you'd have to remember this was describing a different time - one where slavery existed, and Kenya was still a British Colony. What was clear however was that Karen Blixen cared deeply for the Native people that she encountered. \n One thing I found interesting was the legal system the Kikuyu used. Instead of attempting to judge guilt or innocence, they Kikuyu simply demanded payment from the wrong-doer for whatever damages they had done. In the book, the parents of the child who accidentally shoots another child are forced to pay for their childs mistake, even though it was as accident. In todays world, the parents of the shot child would sue the heck out of the parents of the other child, so I suppose in that case the end effect is the same. There are many places where I'm sure this system would break down, and I'd love to discuss it over a few drinks with a lawyer. But I did have to admire the simplicity of it - if you cause another person to have a loss (for whatever reason), you have to make up for it. \n The novel was full of funny little tidbits, all designed to help you get a sense of the people and the world as she saw it. The Merchant of Venice story (p268) stuck out for me - it was hilarious! Here are the relevant lines: \n \"But what else could he do?\" I asked , \"when he must not take one drop of blood?\" \n \"Memsahib\", said Farah, \"he could have used a red-hot knife. That brings out no blood.\" \n \"But\", I said \"he was not allowed to take either more or less than one pound of flesh.\" \n \"And who\", said Farah, \"would have been frightened by that, exactly a Jew? He might have taken little bits at at a time, with a small scale at hand to weight it on, till he had got just one pound. Had the Jew no friends to give him advice?\"",

    "review_text": "I cracked and finally picked this up. Very enjoyable quick read - couldn't put it down - it was like crack. \n I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. \n I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there. \n All in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.",

    "review_text": "A great read for anyone leading or working in a creative team. Delves into the stories of Xerox PARC, Disney, Bill Clinton's election, Black Mountain College, Skunk Works, and The Manhattan Project. Very interesting to read about all these epic creative groups. \n I'm not sure I learned anything revolutionary in this book, but it did help drive home some ideas that I keep running across. \n I think the major takeaway of the book is that great groups need a great purpose. If they believe in the purpose, and a few other things align, then great things can happen. Xerox was out to change the world by introducing the computer. Disney was going to tell stories and inspire imaginations like they've never been told or inspired before. Bill Clinton and his team believed in \n The characteristics of a Great Group are: \n * A huge mission. A massive sense of purpose. Great groups think they are on a mission from God. \n * Superb people. Generalists not specialists. Creative problem solvers. \n * A strong leader \n * A leader who believes in the purpose passionately and can inspire others to see it as well. \n * A leader who knows how to find talent and can recognize it \n * A leader who can assemble personalities that will mesh \n * A leader who optimizes the matching of each group member with the thing they are best at and most passionate about. \n * A leader who shields the team from bureaucracy and fights for them. \n * A place to call their own. Doesn't have to be nice, but has to be separate from everything else. \n * An enemy. Great groups are competitive. \n * Optimism. Optimists accomplish more and are happier. \n * They get stuff done. Real artists ship. \n The one criticism I have of the book is that there aren't nearly enough tangible methods presented. But there were a few: \n * Steve Jobs is known for making Apple into such a strong brand it's almost cultish. One tactic he had for this was hiring evangelists such as Guy Kawasaki whose entire job was to \"keep the Apple cult alive\". \n * PARC leader Bob Taylor had a good tactic for mediating disagreements - he \"would urge people to move from what he called a Class I disagreement, in which neither party could describe the other's position, to a Class 2 disagreement, in which each side could articulate the others stance.\" \n * At PARC they didn't just interview candidates, but they also required them to give a talk before the entire staff - and field sometimes sharp, probing questions.",

    "review_text": "A business classic that everyone should read. Explains 20th century and 21st century economics from a big picture perspective. The basic thesis is that while in the physical world (atoms), products have cost and thus companies can afford to give away small amounts of free samples (5%), or give away cheaper loss-leader related products in order to maintain profits. In the digital world things are reversed as products have little to no marginal cost and companies can afford to give away 95% of the product for free and make money on the remaining 5%. \n My Notes \n * For physical products free is a marketing tactic. Give away one product to make money on another (cell phones to sell plans, razor blades to sell razors, jello cookbooks to sell jello, etc). This is the concept of a \"loss-leader\", and is the basis of much of 20th century marketing. \n * Value psychology: things that were once paid have a difficult time going free because people think it must not be as valuable anymore. Things that have always been free can still have a high perceived value. \n * The Penny-gap: The psychology of a free product versus that of a product costing even one cent is huge. Koppelman says many businesses can't make the leap. Study where truffle is $.15 and kiss is $.01 and 70% choose the truffle, then reduced to .14 and free and now 70% choose the kiss. Free is disposable so we can't make a bad decision by choosing it - it's a psychological thing. \n * Products in a truly competitive market tend to fall to the marginal cost. A true competitive market was mostly an economic theory as most real economies have inefficiencies (the products are somehow differentiated). However with digital economies we finally have true competitive markets, with marginal costs so close to zero that it's often rounded down. \n * Reputation and attention economies are other important things that motivate people. Time is money! People will pay for status or to save time in a game, even if they wouldn't pay for the entire thing. There has been an explosion in gaming lately as games become free to play then charge as people play (Habbo Hotel, WOW, Puzzle Pirates, Second Life, Club Pengiun, Runescape, etc) \n * Giving away your product for free or allowing piracy can be a good thing if you can figure out how to make money from the attention you get as a result. Microsoft would rather people be using pirated versions of Windows & Office than be using a competitor - it establishes them as the market leader and leads to more sales. Bands in China and Brazil give away as many free copies of their album in towns they visit as possible to get everyone to buy a ticket to their concert. \n * Google is the best example of the above. They make so much on advertising from their main product (search + advertising), that they can afford to hire thousands of engineers to work on dozens and dozens of quality products that don't need to make money, they just need to establish Google more as a brand people use (gmail, google docs, google calendar, google apps, youtube, blogger, google analytics, google ad manager, and many more) \n I was also fortunate enough to interview Chris Anderson about this book: check it out here.",

Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit. \n In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.",

Highly recommended for anyone who works and wonders if they shouldn't be paying more attention to their personal happiness. Some great business anecdotes throw in from the authors experience in a top-tier advertising firm in NYC. But mostly this is a story that makes you question the sanity of giving your whole life to a corporation that can easily discard you when you get older. Definitely highlights the importance of doing what you love - even if its working at a coffee shop! \n The other interesting bit was the culture of Starbucks. Instead of giving each other orders, employees are taught to ask each other to \"do me a favor\". They are taught to be 100% positive in everything they do, and to constantly positively reinforce their coworkers. Coworkers are actually called Partners, and patrons are Guests. The language we use is so key to setting the right tone! \n Follow your heart!",

It was a truly interesting premise though: A computer programmer dies of cancer and leaves behind a program that kicks into life when it sees his obituary in the news, and wreaks havoc with some unknown goal in sight. \n In the first half of the book I had a lot of fun trying to imagine the program that Sobol wrote. It was basically a big logic tree, where each possibly outcome in the real world was accounted for in the program. It would have taken a lot of preparation and attention to detail to go through all the possible outcomes and not missing anything, and one bug could make the whole thing fail. Wouldn't that be embarrassing? I guess Sobol had some good unit tests? \n In the second half of the book (trying to not give anything away), the AI goes beyond what I think a skilled programmer could do today. Certainly an interesting thought exercise, but playing up a little bit too much on our fear of \"oh my gosh all information is digital now so a hacker could just take out our whole society!\" Many a hacker has stayed up all night with the same thoughts! \n What I really want to know is where I can get some of those voice projector/sensors?

    "review_text": "Loved every minute. So sad there isn't another! \n I thought JK really made Harry an even stronger archetypal hero - almost in a Paul Maud'Dib from Dune kind of way. He's fighting the ultimate evil, he's brave and takes risks, and believes in himself and doesn't give up despite many hardships. I think JK really did a phenomenal job, as I bet every kid who reads this will have a little bit of hero/Gryffindor in them. \n The epilogue was lame though. I would have rather seen a '3 months later' epilogue than a '19 years later' one.",

    "review_text": "A great book and worth the read, but like many Gladwellian books, it can be summed up easily. The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier. Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. \n Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. \n One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and \"couldn't find any 'naturals'\" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It's kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn't true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. \n One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they're really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest?",

I loved how Lord Byron and other famous poets were running around, and the descriptions of all the beggars were fascinating. Add in some ancient Egyptian magic and you've got a great book! \n Random sidenote: It's interesting to think that back then poets were the rockstars of the age, as the only form of mass-media was newspapers, so those who mastered the written word could be broadcast much further than any musician or actor. How times have changed!",

I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits, originally written as a tale by a father to his children - but I'm glad I wasn't. \n I found the folk tales about El-ahrairah to be very impressive. The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history. But I think this book was worth reading as it's really a story about survival, leadership, and human nature. \n Oh and Fiver rocks. And BigWig is the man.",

    "review_text": "A great snapshot of history. It's about the experiences of ordinary French people as they flee Paris in 1940 when the Germans are invading. The second part is about after the Germans occupy France, how people in the towns get along with their hosts. \n I loved the class breakdowns that occur. When the rules of society are no longer being enforced, having money or being a famous writer no longer make you more special than the next person. The descriptions of the characters prejudices, which were mostly based on their class, were really well done. \n The story of the German officer falling in love with his French host took me a while to get into, but towards the end the emotions they both felt were really well described. You could really feel the how torn they were about it. \n I went to a bookclub that discussed this book and was surprised to hear the variety of opinions on this book. The most interesting angle to me was: why did she paint such a positive picture of the Germans when she was of Jewish decent (and was indeed later killed in Auschwitz). Some people argued that she didn't yet know of the atrocities. Others thought maybe it was a hedge in case she was caught so she could show how sympathetic she was. And others thought she was just a writer caught up in telling a story. I favor the first and last options :)",

    "review_text": "My safari guide gave this to me, saying the author was a friend who had lived a life similar to his own. It's a very well-written memoir style book of a man who is raised among a very proud people called the Maasai in East Africa. By modern standards they live very primitive lives: herding cattle, and living in dirt huts. But some of them are sent to school and enter the modern world, and the juxtaposition of the author's viewpoint on both worlds makes for a great read. \n One interesting thing I noticed was that one reason the author was able to get so far in life was that as a safari guide back in the day, he met exclusively rich and powerful people as his clients. They were the only ones who could afford it back then! Just goes to show that its all about who you know!",

    "review_text": "I learned a lot about an area of the world I knew very little. The book was a journalistic nonfiction account of Sierra Leone, as opposed to the fictional movie (which I also enjoyed). \n Key takeaways: \n - Human beings can be pretty indecent to each other when the economic incentives are right, and when there are no checks on those in charge. The RUF murdered and mutilated thousands. \n - There is *no* way to verify a diamond is not a conflict diamond. No matter what a diamond seller says, stones are untraceable and black market stones can be added in at any of a dozen of places on the way from the mine to the store. Only stores like DeBeers, who control their own mines and stores, can approach such a guarantee. \n - The guy who started DeBeers was impressive. He bought up as many mines as he could instead of mining them, and eventually controlled the market. DeBeers has had some shady practices as the worlds biggest diamond buyer and mine owner. \n - DeBeers has a monopoly on diamonds, and as such can't have more than 3 executives in the US at any time or they will be arrested for prosecution by the SEC. \n - DeBeers has a stockpile of diamonds in London worth billions. Selling it would flood the market. \n - In late 2001, a Washington Post reporter broke a story that Osama Bin Laden had been buying conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone for a the past year to convert his money to a liquid form. This was in preparation for Sept 11, as he knew the US would seize his funds after the attack. Its very likely the scheme worked, and conflict diamonds are what is funding him today.",

    "review_text": "Great book. Quick read, and you learn about about psychology that you can apply to life or business. \n A few notes: \n - All about first impressions. First impressions can sway our opinion of something for years to come regardless of subsequent performance. \n - Labels matter. If you label someone as a higher performer, top of class, leader, having command potential, etc - it will translate into them actually having it. My high school motto was Principes Non Homines (leaders not men) - now I know why they thought that would work. \n - When we brand or label people they take on the characteristics of the diagnosis. \n - People are easily swayed when other people they deal with are decent or nice or fair to them. You enjoy a restaurant 10 times more if the waiter is really nice, regardless of the food (the product). Same goes for any service or business relationship. \n - Heightened adrenaline levels lead to higher levels of romantic interest \n - We have \"two engines\" running in our brain that don't operate simultaneously. So we usually approach things from either an altruistic perspective or a self-interested one. Money (self-interest) is not always the best motivator - sometimes pride (in your country, your city, what you do) will inspire people much more.",

    "review_text": "Very fascinating take on how Leopold was able to obtain a colony many times bigger than Belgium with pure politics, and maintain it with forced slavery and mercenaries. \n There are lots of business lessons to be learned from Leopold: \n - Perception is reality. The reality was forced slavery, and unspeakable cruelty by Leopold's agents. But in Europe Leopold told over and over the story that he was a humanitarian, and had the best interests of the Congo people in mind. \n - You can control reality. Leopold wined and dined, and even bribed anyone with the ability to hurt the perception he spun of the Congo. Harder to do today, but not impossible. For instance a web startup just has to get cozy with Arrington and funding is around the corner. Leopold wasn't a king - he was a master at PR. \n - History is written by the victors. Most published accounts of the era came from Leopold or his agents. Thus most people had no idea what was happening. I've seen this in current times: an authoritative article by a prominent newspaper that gets things wrong - then for people later researching the subject it becomes a source, and the myth builds. Thats what good PR can do! \n - Economic incentive without proper checks can result in just about anybody becoming corrupt. Lots of \"good\" people in the book did unspeakable things to the natives for the sake of meeting their quota of ivory or rubber, or because they were ordered to. Similar stories have been told of American soldiers in Vietnam. In my view this pretty much proves man is neither inherently good or evil, but is entirely motivated by peer pressure and/or money. Joseph Conrad captured this well in Heart of Darkness",

I have two biases though: one was I was in Africa at the time I read it, and the other is my grandfather did a lot of hunting in Africa in the 1960's, so I could almost picture him hanging out with the wild characters in the book. \n What I loved were all the stories of hunts and the pioneer type hunters that led them. Numerous maulings and close calls dealing with all sorts of animals. Surprisingly, the most dangerous animals in Africa are (in order): Buffalo, Elephant, Leopard, Lion, Rhino. Unless you wound the Lion then he's #1. Don't mess with Simba.",

    "review_text": "\"Dr Livingstone, I presume!\" \n That phrase was buried in my mind somewhere. It was familiar, yet I knew not how nor who this Livingstone person was. This book explained it, and was very entertaining in the process. Highly recommended if you ever travel to East Africa. \n A friend recently wrote an interesting piece about how the types of creative people that rise to be famous have changed over the years. Livingstone was an explorer in the mid-1800's, and was a Michael Jordan of England. He explored much of Africa, often being the only white man in the expedition. He abhorred slavery, which was then rampant, and fought against it. His quest was to find the source of the Nile river, which evidently was a big thing back then (today we just keep looking for 'dark matter' and other such stuff). \n But the most interesting part of the book to me was that the reason we know that famous phrase, is that its an early example of newspaper sensationalism. The New York Observer paid a reporter (Stanley) to take ridiculously large and expensive expedition into the middle of Africa that lasted for years, just to be able to have the exclusive on the story. But it was worth it: millions of Americans were entertained for years by the articles on Stanley's quest. And England wasn't happy its superstar was found by an American either, a fact not lost on the Observer.",

I think anytime one undertake's an adventure or a journey like that you grow so much. You have to get out there and fail a few times to have the confidence to know how to succeed! \n I also have to say I loved Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar.

It was a memoir style account of desert warfare in world war 2, and a fascinating and realistic account of what it was like. A little heavier on logistics (names/places/etc) in a few places than I would have liked, but that did make it seem very real. \n I loved the descriptions of Rommel's tank tactics: \"tied in forces will hold and forces in the air will run\". It was also interesting to note that most of the special ops were doing recon - which today would be done via satellites. \n My generation has never lived through a world war, and reading this really brought to light the fact that a war of that magnitude really changes a society. Everyone fights from famous rugby stars to oxford scholars to high school teachers. The only take-away is that war is fucked up and I hope we never have to do it again. But if we go by history...",

    "review_text": "An epic book - loved it, and wish I had found it before now. It does start a bit slow, but then really picks up. It's the story of a young man in 1905ish who graduates from Harvard and then is sent by his rich uncle to be the consul to the made up country of Islandia, which is closed to trade with the outside world. \n Islandia is described so clearly you could almost believe it wasn't a made up country. You can feel it's beauty, it's pureness, and it's culure, coming through the pages. \n Many of us went through idealistic phases in our 20's, and John Lang is no exception. He is trying to decide what will make him happy: Islandia, or a life in New York as a businessman. He is also searching for love, and seems to have a crush on every Islandian woman he meets! \n Wright does an amazing job of describing what the Islandian culture is like. They are largely farmers: they work in the field all day, and their land provides what they need to eat and money to buy the rest. They don't have to work super hard, and have plenty of time for leisure. Their society closed and smaller, so people are very decent to each other. There aren't very many towns or central social hubs, so socializing is often accomplished by staying as a guest in someones farm house as you are traveling through the country, and you can do that totally unannounced. \n Islandia is a utopia of sorts - they believe that progress in their culture will not lead to improving their lives. It is an interesting question - does technological progress actually end up making our lives better? Technology is supposed to improve the quality of our lives. We have better medicines, cleaner cities, we can communicate instantly around the world, and travel on cars and trains and planes. \n But we lack the notion of a \"home\" that spans across generations or even multiple family units. Cousins and uncles and grandparents are only seen several times a year during family parties and holidays. In a sense, our society has shifted from being family centric to friend centric, as friends are the people we hang out with socially in the cities, where most of us live. This gives us often a richer variety of people and ideas to interact with, but the the connections are often not as close, and that is sad.",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I absolutely loved the first book, but didn't think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. \n Too many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. Maybe it was because it's supposed to be a children's book, but I didn't like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God's #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. \n On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children's book :) I did like the Dante's Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman's description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa's world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians. I'm usually not a tragedy fan, but I did think Lyra & Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending.",

    "review_text": "I found this book on a recommendation from a good friend, and if it wasn't for that I might have put it down right away, because the tone is very markety, and the author makes a lot of big claims with little substance. \n That being said, the author must be a smart guy because there is a lot of good stuff in this book. \n Big Takeaways \n 1. Most of us have the idea that we are supposed to work until we are 60, then retire and live the good life. Tim does a great job pointing out how backwards that idea is, and gives lots of suggestions for how to change your life to accommodate. He calls those who have done so the \"New Rich\", as they are rich in life - which is not related to being rich in dollars. \n 2. Take 'mini-retirements' throughout your life instead of planning to retire at the end of your life (which I probably wouldn't do anyways). This means every 5 years take a year off to go on a big adventure. Tim's point is you don't need to be rich to do this, and gives a lot of advice on how to go about it. I don't think he'll convince too many people, but it does sound like he's starting to have a following. \n 3. Be a business owner - not a business runner. One gives you lots of free time - the other consumes your life (which I can currently attest to :) \n 4. Time is your most valuable asset. Tim gives a lot of good tips for time management - which aren't unique, but every time you read them helps you. The ones that stuck out for me were: \n - only check email 3 times a day at set intervals \n - outsource everything you can to 3rd parties (like a virtual concierge in India who works for $5/hr) \n - batch activities like paying bills for max efficiency \n - give employees autonomous rules/guidelines \n - avoid meetings whenever possible - use emails instead (works wonders) \n 5. Try to start businesses that can be completely outsourced after you've set them up, so they run on auto-pilot. The author did it with a nutrient company - I'm dubious on this one though. \n 6. 80/20 rule. 80% of your revenue probably comes from 20% of your customers. You can save a lot of time and make more money by focusing where it matters - on the 20%. This applies to most things in life, and although I've read it before it was a good refresher. \n 7. Reach out to important people. Don't be afraid to reach out to important/famous people for advice. They are often more accessible than you think. Tim had good tips for this - like always uses phone's and not emails. \n 8. Avoid excessive information: too much information input can overload you, so avoid reading news on subjects that don't relate to what you do. If something important happens in the world you will hear about it - or its good conversation when you meet with a friend (\"whats new in the world?\")",

I came into the documentary very wary, having heard rumors about alternative motives, political agendas, etc. It might still be true. My main criticism with it was the lack of scientific 'proof'. We saw a lot compelling graphs, but didn't hear their sources or meet respected scientists who back them. Gore clearly isn't a journalist. \n But despite all that, Gore has given us a lot of good food for thought on a subject that *definitely* matters a lot. So kudos to him! Now I just have to do some more learning - any recommendations?",

    "review_text": "I'm not sure if I love Khaled's characters (see my review of The Kite Runner), but the man can tell a story. I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way. \n So a little sad, but I liked it. I think the thing I liked most was that I've read so few books about that area of the world, and now I feel like I've gotten to know it, just a tiny bit.",

I have it on audio too and listen to it at the gym often. \n Napoleon Hill was tasked by Andrew Carnegie to write a book on what made a successful person succeed, and he spent 20 years researching and interviewing every great name of the day (Ford, Woolworth, Edison, etc), plus lots of people who failed (because you have to know what doesn't work too). This book is the result. \n It basically hammers home a single point, over and over again. Success comes from knowing what you want to achieve and having a burning desire to achieve it. \n \"The starting point of all achievements is desire. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat.\"",

    "review_text": "I really enjoyed this book. The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. \n I think my favorite part of this book is the word 'grok'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is 'to be enlightened about something'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you're also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like 'grok' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn't forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was \"a Martian word\"! \n One thing that I grokked (yes I'm going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60's manifesto for free love. I wasn't alive in the 60's, but given everything I know about the 60's from movies, books, etc it seemed that my grokking was right.",

    "review_text": "Recommended in Stanford Magazine and by Guy Kawasaki. \n A very useful book about the growth mindset. Essentially, the book makes a case that those people who look at everything they do in life as a learning opportunity are much more successful. \n I think where this comes into play most often is when we face a setback, or a failure. Whether thats getting rejected from something (a job, a team, etc), messing up at work, having your boss yell at you, losing at something, getting laid off, making a bad bet, etc - most of us have many setbacks in our lives. How we deal with those is incredibly important. If we let the setback define us, we might think we aren't talented after all, and lose confidence. If on the other hand, we look at it as something we can learn from, we improve as a person. \n I came at the book as it was recommended to me as being good for parents. My daughter is only 1.6 years, but already she is learning fast. The book recommends praising our children's efforts, instead of their results. Telling them they are \"amazing\", and \"smart\" is so easy to do, but if you do that their whole lives they won't succeed when they get to the real world. What you want is to encourage a learning attitude. This quote sums it up: \n \"So what should we say when children complete a task--say, math problems--quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, \"Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time. Let's do something you can really learn from!\" \n Looking at life as a constant challenge is fun. And you can't fail at a personal challenge! Here is a great mental imagery technique the book mentioned when you are doing something you are bad at: \n \"Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going.\" \n Another interesting bit was how people at the top of their game can get caught up in a fixed mindset. You see this in sports all the team - the champion team from last year thinks they can cruise through this year, doesn't work hard, and suddenly they are losing a lot. It's so hard to maintain the edge. John Wooden puts it best: \n \"I believe ability can get you to the top,\" says coach John Wooden, \"but it takes character to keep you there.... It's so easy to ... begin thinking you can just 'turn it on' automatically, without proper preparation. It takes real character to keep working as hard or even harder once you're there. When you read about an athlete or team that wins over and over and over, remind yourself, 'More than ability, they have character.'\"",

    "review_text": "A very interesting and very French perspective on the Google Book Search project and digitization in general. Jeanneney basically makes the point that there are certain dangers for France and Europe since Google, which is an American company, has undertaken the monumental task of digitizing a great deal of the world's knowledge. His worry is that Google will prioritize in the digitization queue primarily books in english, as well books that are most pertinent to American culture. Now since human knowledge is little more than the sum of our written history, this unfair digitization has the potential in coming years to cause damage to cultures that aren't represented in it. \n Jeanneney is (very wisely actually) trying to create an uproar around the issue in order to rally support in the EU around creating and funding a European digitization project. He even presents all the possibilities: 1. government funding 2. create their own search engine 3. do it open source wikipedia style. \n I sympathize and even understand Jeanneney's perspective (although did I mention it was very French?:). But what was most interesting to me was that I realized how lucky I am to live in a country where Capitalism is at work. What Jeanneney is so desperate to accomplish in Europe has happened in America not magically or by chance, but because of incentive. In Freakonomics I think the author said something like \"economics is the study of incentives\". And Google is evidently has incentive to scan a whole lotta books. \n One last thought. At the end Jeanneney finally gets to the interesting part, and wonders what to do with this cultural wealth of 1's and 0's once its been created. He says: \"Here again, the government, taking care not to stifle imagination or inhibit civic efforts, must be the driving force.\" Talk about lack of incentive. I wonder who will be better at figuring out a good way to organize and search all the worlds data: Google, or the EU? My money is on Larry and Sergey all the way.",

    "review_text": "Loved every second of this book. Each chapter is a different story of a startup founder. I read it slowly so it wouldn't end, and read many chapters twice. My biggest take was that most founders didn't necessarily know what they were doing - or even that they were on to something big. But they were all determined to start a company - that was the only thing they all had in common. \n Here are some good quotes from the book: \n \"I'd say determination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the founders I spoke with were superhuman in any way, it was in their perseverance.\" \n -- Jessica Livingston (the author) \n \"I see way too many people give up in the startup world. They just give up too easily. Recruiting is a classic example. I don't even hear the first \"no\" that somebody says. When they say, \"No, I'm not interested\", I think \"Now it's a real challenge. Now's when the tough part begins.\" It's hard to identify talent, but great people don't look for jobs, great people are sold on jobs. And if they're sold they're going to say no at first. You have to win them over.\" \n -- Joe Kraus (founder of Excite) \n \"Ultimately, you cannot accomplish something completely on your own. You really need to develop a network of people who win when you win.\" \n -- Ray Ozzie (Founder of Groove Networks, Chief Architect of Microsoft) \n \"My philosophy on these types of companies - consumer-based Internet companies - is that you don't need to worry about the business model initially. If you get users, then everything else follows. Basically any technology can be copied, any concept can be copied. In my opinion, what makes one of these companies valuable is the users. That can't be copied\" \n -- Mark Fletcher (Founder of eGroups and Bloglines) \n \"I am not a hunter, never have fired a gun, but I'm told that if you want to shoot a duck, you have to shoot where the duck is going to be, not where the duck is. It's the same with introducing technology: if you're only focused on the market today, by the time you introduce your solution to that problem, there'll probably be several others already entrenched.\" \n -- Charles Geschke (Founder of Adobe Systems) \n \"The biggest thrill is frankly not the financial success, it's the ability to have an impact. Because we're both engineers at heart and that's every engineer's dream - to build something that millions of people will use.\" \n -- Charles Geschke (Founder of Adobe Systems) \n \"Most programmers don't think about the user experience. They get a spec book, and they say, \"Well, I'm going to meet this spec to make the customer happy.\" That's not really enough; you have to make something good for the user if you want to call yourself an engineer.\" \n -- Philip Greenspun (Founder of ArsDigita) \n \"People don't like to write. It's hard. The people who were really good software engineers were usually great writers; they had tremendous ability to organize their thoughts and communicate. The people who were sort of average-quality programmers and had trouble thinking about the larger picture were the ones who couldn't write.\" \n -- Philip Greenspun (Founder of ArsDigita) \n \"Things never work out right the first time. You've always got to do it two or three times to get it right. And things always go wrong. So persistence is the key to success. I had seen that in my career. I had seen that in computer design projects. I had seen that through my whole life. And so that word is the best single advice I can give to entrepreneurs. The key to success, if you had to sum it up in one, is persistence.\" \n -- Ron Gruner (Founder of Alliant Computer Systems and Shareholder.com) \n \"I'd just keep thinking, keep trying to find the language and find new employees, trying to meet the VC who would understand my vision and back me. I met with 43 VCs.\" \n -- James Currier (Founder of Tickle.com)",

    "review_text": "Sometimes you just need a quick fun book. I read this over Easter weekend, and loved every second. I loved the movie too, but the book was better. \n This book really wasn't intellectual, but it did make one interesting point. In the book you can only vote if you have gone through and graduated from military training. This prevents the uneducated and uncommitted citizens from voting. While this is a bit extreme, I might be of the opinion that there should be some more barriers to voting (like a standardized test). Otherwise our elections end up being a marketing contest. Name recognition is huge in marketing - would W have won otherwise? Would Hilary have a chance?",

Kiyosacki pointed out though that if you look at return on your money real estate wins hands down because you only have to put in 10% of your own money. So if you buy a 100K house with 10K, borrowing the 90K, and it appreciates to 105K after a year - you've got a 50% return.",

    "review_text": "I first read this after college when my father gave it to me as a graduation gift. I almost didn't read it, but was very glad I did as it was very impactful on me, and I think helped shape me into the person I am today. I recently decided to re-read it after a meditation teacher was talking about it - and was glad to discover that it's just as relevant to my life now as it was before. It's a book I can easily see myself re-reading every 5-10 years. \n The book is a story about how to be mindful and live a happy, aware life - coached in the story of young Berkeley gymnast who meets an old man - who he names Socrates - at a gas station. Socrates becomes his coach and mentor - and teaches him that his goals in life were all wrong. \n If there is a motto of the book it's this quote, which I've had on my wall since I first read this book: \n \"There are no ordinary moments!\" \n The way of the peaceful warrior is to appreciate every moment, regardless of how dull or ordinary it may seem. To live in the now. Once you become aware of this, it's kind of amazing how much of our time we don't spend in the current moment - instead worrying about the past or the future. Our minds are swimming with the thoughts and worries of our lives, and we lack the easy ability to just be present. As Socrates said: \n My mind is like a pond without ripples. Your mind is full of waves because you feel separated from, and often threatened by, an unplanned, unwelcome occurrence. Your mind is like a pond into which someone has just dropped a boulder!\" \n The best way to live in the present moment is to learn to meditate. Meditation teaches you to become aware when the mind wanders, and that awareness is a muscle that like all muscles, needs constant exercise or it becomes diminished. What I liked about the book was it discusses where meditation can go - and how one can be meditating constantly. In fact, it's not really meditation, but the art of focusing the mind that feels so good and fulfilling to us. This is why sports are so great - you are forced to focus your mind 100% on what you are doing, and distracting thoughts fade to the background. That ability to focus is calming, and appealing. I like how the book explains that using gymnastics. \n \"Silence is the warrior's art -- and meditation is his sword. With it, you'll cut through your illusions. But understand this: the sword's usefulness depends upon the swordsman. If you don't know how to use the weapon properly, it can become a dangerous, deluding, or useless tool. Meditation can initially help you to relax. You may put your 'sword' on display, proudly show it to friends. The gleam of this sword distracts many meditators until they abandon it to seek other esoteric techniques.\" \n But I liked how the book goes much deeper than meditation. There were cool bits about breathing properly, monitoring your internal organs, massage, having the mindset of a child, and eating healthily. \n \"The pleasure from eating, Dan, is more than the taste of the food and the feeling of a full belly. Learn to enjoy the entire process -- the hunger beforehand, the careful preparation, setting an attractive table, chewing, breathing, smelling, tasting, swallowing, and the feeling of lightness and energy after the meal. You can even enjoy the full and easy elimination of the food after it's digested. When you pay attention to all elements of the process, you'll begin to appreciate simple meals.\" \n Highly recommended.",

    "review_text": "I haven't read a good spy novel in a while - and this was a great one. Truly well written, and an amazing story given how short the book is. I tore through it in one day! \n It really dove into what it's like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what's best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time \"coming in from the cold\" - as did Laemas. \n The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That's impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. \n The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas' love interest)'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.",

It was basically a story about a small town where the gene pool is so small that everyone marries their relations, and it seems like life spirals more and more downward and out of control over 100 years. I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one's quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending. \n I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist. Melquiades's scrolls, the floating priest, etc. According to Wikipedia this is called \"magical realism\". Thinking about all the movies and TV shows being produced now, it seems that this is a common plot element nowadays!",

    "review_text": "This book was a pure delight. The subtitle \"Adventures of a Curious Character\" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories. \n One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) \n I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. \n Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. \n I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.",

    "review_text": "Almost every surfer I know has recommended this, so I finally read it. I've never really found a surf book I liked, but this was closest. I'm not sure if the author and I would have been surf buddies (he's 50, a longboarder, picks fights, and used to run drugs), but he's definitely a great story-teller. And his adventures traveling from Mexico to Costa Rica are a trip. He does a great job weaving in stories from his younger days, stories of his pot smuggling days, and stories of his journey to make a very good beach read. I loved hearing the stories of all the people he meets - half the expats down south are 'on the run' - and have great stories :) \n Aside from the good storytelling I felt there was depressing undertone to the book, as if the author was never quite satisfied with his life regardless of what happened to him. This makes sense I suppose given he's kinda having a midlife crisis - but it didn't amp me up with enthusiasm for life. But on the positive side, it did gave me a strong thirst to explore central america soon - and to go surfing :)",

Watching Holmes apply his methods to each case and unravel it to the eternaly baffled Watson was entertaining and even inspiring. I only wish I was as smart as Sherlock. I actually think we can all learn a lot from Sherlock - even if he is fictional :) \n Some other interesting things I learned: \n - sherlock only says 'elementary' once \n - sherlock does cocaine when bored in between cases . I guess it wasn't such a big deal back then? \n - one caper delved into the history of the Mormons, which was very interesting",

    "review_text": "The second volume of the masterful Sherlock Holmes. The first was probably better, but this was a very good read as well. I have all the respect for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he really makes you believe in Holmes' genius. \n One interesting tidbit is that he killed Holmes off at the end of the last book, because he thought he was \"obscuring my higher work\". Ironic since none of his other work has any popularity. Due to popular demand, Holmes returned 20 years later. \n A great quote: \n \"I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uese of dogs in the work of the detective ... A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.\" \n so true!",

But hearing it in a cohesive story is a great way to fodder new ideas - if you wanna think about the internet and where its going, its a great primer - and a quick read too. \n Hearing the the Goto/Overture story was interesting. While it sounds obvious, its an impressive insight by Bill Gross that traffic with an intent (ie search traffic) is worth more than random traffic, and that if you played arbitrage in the middle you could make a lot of money. I like it when people can do math :) \n I didn't know Google started in a garage. I learned more about Google's battle to stop SEO spammers. They usually change their algorithm to do this, which of course ends up screwing over legit businesses too - these legit businesses actually name each algorithm change like they were hurricanes - 'Florida' was when Google changed their algorithm on nov 14, 2003.",

    "review_text": "I read this in high school, and it was one of my favorite's at the time. I just re-read it as the movie is out, and was glad to see it's still one of my favorites. Ender is pretty much just badass. The military strategy and leadership is actually one of my favorite things about this book. \n The notion that Ender was set apart from the other kids as an intentional tactic to make him into a leader was always fascinating to me. In many ways I can relate to it. Ender's story is one of leadership, and leaders often have to balance empathy with big picture priorities. His older brother was too harsh and lacked empathy - but Ender is the perfect balance. \n One of the key ways Ender keeps winning is by being aggressive and proactive, rather than reactive. Both with the bullies, in war games, and with the buggers, he takes them out before they have the chance to take him out: \n \"Knocking him down won the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones, too. So they'd leave me alone.\" \n \"When it comes down to it, though, the real decision is inevitable: If one of us has to be destroyed, let's make damn sure we're the ones alive at the end. Our genes won't let us decide any other way. Nature can't evolve a species that hasn't a will to survive. Individuals might be bred to sacrifice themselves, but the race as a whole can never decide to cease to exist. So if we can we'll kill every last one of the buggers, and if they can they'll kill every last one of us.\" \n I didn't fully understand the point of the plot line about Enders brother and sister becoming net celebrities. I mean it was cool, but this cartoon summarizes it well: http://xkcd.com/635/ \n What I like about this book is that Ender is pushed to his limits to improve himself, which shows a raw side of humanity. It makes you think. Here is a quote which I think encapsulates that well: \n \"There is no teacher but the enemy. No one but the enemy will tell you what the enemy is going to do. No one but the enemy will ever teach you how to destroy and conquer. Only the enemy shows you where you are weak. Only the enemy tells you where he is strong. And the only rules of the game are what you can do to him and what you can stop him from doing to you.\"",

    "review_text": "My old CEO and mentor (James Currier) gave me this book for christmas after I first started work at his company. He said they handed it out at HBS and it was a simple but very powerful intro to managing your finances. And it was. So forget Personal Finance For Dummies (which I also read) - start with this. \n Personal finance is something that isn't taught in school, but is incredibly important - and the basics aren't very hard. I found this book invaluable as a young software engineer, when I was making a salary and didn't know how to invest it, and I would recommend it for anyone in their 20's. Even if all it does is get you to start to think about compound interest and what starting to save can do for you - that's *huge*.",

    "review_text": "Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think. \n three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. \n Law of the Few (people who influence): \n - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. \n - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. \n - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into \"conversational harmony\" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. \n Stickyness Factor \n - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show \n was good. \n - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. \n - make the message personal to make it memorable \n The Power of Context \n - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. \n - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. \n - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. \n - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.",

    "review_text": "Interesting Tidbits \n - Three forces need to create the long tail: \n 1. democratize production: give average people the ability to create quality content (movies, music, blogs) \n 2. democratize distribution: technology to aggregate *all* the content in a genre (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes) \n 3. Connect Supply and Demand: filters to help people find the niche's they are interested in (Google, recommendations, best-seller lists) \n - One quarter of Amazon's sales come from books outside its top 100,000 titles. Thus having a long tail adds ~33% to your bottom line. \n - Ranking bestsellers across niche's genre's gives little value. Filters to rank items must be applied within each niche to become relevant. Goodreads could improve here. \n - As the number of niche's increases, the ability of people to consume more content within the genre increases. This depends on the genre, but it gives me hope that we can increase the number of people who read through Goodreads, by creating better filters to connect readers of various niche's. \n - each year 200,000 books are published in english, and fewer than 20,000 make it into a bookstore. Only 2% of the books published in 2004 sold more than 5000 copies, and can be considered profitable. \n - There is another factor that determines why people create content, other than money: reputation. \n - Ebay has 60 million active users",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n So the other day Elizabeth and I are in the book store and she saw this book, and said she really wanted me to read it. In horror at the thought of reading what I thought was a 'chick book', i immediately countered that she would then have to read one of my favorites: Dune. She agreed! \n So I read it, and I have to admit, it was good - damn good. Even though there was a serious lack of any gratuitous violence, I tore through it in several days. Austen is an amazing writer, and has a particular talent for explaining her characters deep motivations (or prejudices) in a few defining sentences. \n I think my favorite part of it is the unwinding of Elizabeths' prejudices against Mr Darcy. It is done so slowly and artfully and believably that the reader is completely pulled into the story. \n It is a definite period piece - here are a few funny observations: \n - Nobody in the book had a job - they all earned income from their estates \n - Since nobody had jobs they spent all day gossiping \n - People were judged not by what they did for a living but what family they were from and how they behaved in society. Completely different from today! \n - Dating was much tougher back then. You needed at least 10 dates to get anywhere, and you probably had to marry in order to go all the way. \n Jokes aside, this is a classic, and I highly recommend it for any guy or girl.",

    "review_text": "Just re-read this for the first time, and it's still one of my favorites. This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. \n It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. \n I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). \n The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! \n If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.",

    "review_text": "When people ask me what my favorite book is, Dune is always my answer. Words cannot even do justice to what an epic tale this is. We learn about spirituality, human nature, politics, religion, and the making of a hero. \n I loved the spiritual aspects of the book the best. The philosophies and practices and Pranu Bindu training of the Bene Gesserit that Paul learns and builds upon. The Bene Gesserit believe in a training regiment that results in a superior human being - one with every sense as refined as possible. This means a focus on learning, on controlling emotion, on controlling your body. \n My absolute favorite quote from Dune is the Bene Gesserit litany against fear: \n \"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\" \n The litany is meant to be recited when you are in a moment of fear, and as I first read Dune 20 years ago, I've employed it many times. After Paul employs it when he is fighting Jamis, the affect on him is described as \"a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready.\" I have read a lot about people who perform at high levels - whether it be in athletics or business, and success is all about getting into that zen state where you have a clear, focused mind. Fear is the biggest thing that can cloud one's mind - usually fear of failure, but there are other forms too. While this Litany won't always eliminate it, I've felt it to be useful to recognize the fear and call it out for what it is. \n There is also a focus in the book on being able to read people by paying attention to the minutia. In many crucial scenes we see Paul and Jessica and others employing this skill, using not only their eyes, but reading the tone of what a person says, what their body language or actions say, and more. Imagine the poker player I could be if I learned these skills! \n \"If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.\" \n It's interesting to me that so many science fiction novels contemplate a future with AI (aka post-singularity). In Dune, the Butlerian Jihad was the human rebellion to rid itself of AI or \"thinking machines\". They are now banned, and in their place we have Mentats, who are humans with processing powers far greater than any thinking machine. It's unclear to the software engineer in me how exactly that could be without some sort of physical manipulation (insertion of massive amounts of transistors, for instance), but the affect is pretty cool, we get Spock-esque beings who analyze everything extremely logically, and are great at political planning \"feints within feints within feints\". \n There was a lot in the book about leadership. It started with Paul first learning about it from his Father, and also from the Bene Gesserit. This quote stood out to me: \n \"She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\" Paul said. \"And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\" She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue. \"She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\" \n Later as he grows into a leader himself, Paul learns that the most essential ingredient to be a leader is to lead people to a worthy goal. \n \"It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul's place for him.\" \n Much has been made in modern reviews of Dune of the fact that it's clearly a statement about oil and the Middle East. The book even admits the Fremen are of Sunni descent, and many words they use (Jinn, Jihad, etc) are Arabic. I'm not sure I understand all the undertones, but one thing that was clear was about control of the worlds most precious commodity: \"The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.\" I hope we are closing in on the end of the days when oil controls so much, but we aren't there yet. In the meantime, we had best beware of any future Harkonnen's.",

    "review_text": "This book is, so many times over, a true story. Culleton does not hold back in her descriptions of the horrors these women faced. However, from true stories I've heard, it is not even close to as horrible as it gets. The way native people have been treated in this country (and elsewhere) is shameful. The trickledown effect of residential schooling and prejudice has scarred our history (and is sadly, still perpetuated) and so many seem unaware. Those that say this book has an agenda... well, it certainly should. \n The author, in my opinion, successfully wrote on the issue of generational pain without making it seem as though she was \"making excuses\" (a common complaint I hear from prejudice types). The two little girls grew up in an unstable home, had their lives torn apart, and faced hardships throughout their lives. I particularly identified with Cheryl who tried desperately to turn her pain into positive action and struggled so deeply. \n The other themes she explores include cultural identity, skin colour, addiction, family... She also explores the question of personal strength which I think is something universal. \n The style of the writing is not the type that usually draws me in, but the story itself needs to be heard. It felt, to me, like April's real voice. Some might say it's too \"simplistic\" but I don't think every fictional book needs to sound like poetry to resonate.",

    "review_text": "This is foremost, a book about people. Taylor begins as a somewhat naive young woman who has dreams bigger than her reality. Reading through Taylor's perspective made me feel nostalgic for my younger years where there seemed to be so many possibilities. I really love how the author explores common character types without bordering too much on stereotyping; these are real people we have probably all met at least once. \n I've read that some felt Taylor was too changeable. I want to humbly point out that many girls her age... are. In that in-between stage from adolescence to true adulthood, I think it's easy to struggle to find your voice. But the progression in her thinking felt very believable to me. \n I think it's important to understand Kingsolver's style. She has a way of seamlessly interweaving fantasy elements into stories that make you feel almost like you're hearing a story by word of mouth (how many people spin tales when they tell a story that happened to a \"friend of a friend\"). That to me creates a sense of intimacy with the story and characters. \n At first, I was expecting an entirely realistic tale and kept asking \"why didn't Taylor call the police? why didn't she report the abuse?\" But. That wouldn't make a very good story, now would it? ;) To be fair, I agree with some reviews that say this combination of VERY intense themes (child abuse, immigration, racism, etc) with unrealistic elements/heartwarming emotions can be a bit disarming. I felt a little unsettled reading of Turtle's abuse and the rest of the book didn't have such an intense tone, but I feel that is realistic. Often, horrific things happen, and life just goes on. But keeping an open mind, I do think this was a good book, to put it simply. I was rooting for Taylor and of course, for Turtle.",

Written in first person, it draws you into the life of Aminata; the harrowing experiences she faced as a child thrust into slavery and many further heartaches. But it is not simply a tale of sorrow; it offers inspiration through her bravery and strength as she manages to make peace with her life in her later years. I felt a great deal of compassion for her, not simply on a base level, but as though she were a friend. It's historically educational as well. I feel like the reason this book is so popular is that it truly has \"something for everyone\" in way of genre. I cannot imagine this story not drawing compassion; one would have to be heartless.",

It came off as a whiny, self absorbed child ranting in a journal. In serious need of editing, to say the least. I feel like her whiny demeanour could do more harm than good in trying to gain compassion for those who have struggled. \n She is very defensive of herself and makes a lot of excuses for smoking and getting pregnant in a less than healthy situation to bring an infant into. \n Her childhood was certainly difficult but she talks about it like she has the worst life in the world. Of course pain is not measurable, but I feel like this girl is making a lot of excuses for her own lack of self control. While insensitive and his motives questionable, there are certainly worse villains than her step-father. I'm glad that it does not seem that he acted on his perverted intentions, if he did have them. And if he does not, he needs serious schooling on what is appropriate parent behavior, creepy. \n I'm just not sure what the point of this book is, really. To encourage kids not to follow in her foot steps? To get pity? I don't know.",

    "review_text": "Enjoyable read! I liked that Connie is not a typical cold-hearted, sexy, perfect, genius, vampire hunter. She's like a real person with flaws and weaknesses and fears. \n I really enjoyed the style of writing. I'm not usually a big fan of first person perspective, but I feel the author used a great balance of dialogue, descriptive text, and the character's \"voice\" really shone through without being too colloquial. \n Vampire fiction is a tricky subject these days as it's becoming so common, but I feel like this book was unique enough to stand out. I can't wait to read more!",

    "review_text": "The story begins with a young boy and his friends witnessing a tragic accident - or so it seems. There is a very high chance that this boy and his friends may have caused it by a childish mistake. A magician is wrongfully imprisoned for the death of his partner and vows to take revenge on the children who were truly to blame. \n Fast forward to the present time. The children have grown and gone on with their lives. The story that unfolds seeks to shed light on what truly happened as well as what happens when the magician begins to hunt them down. \n I struggled to finish the story. It was not that the story wasn't well written, but I found myself not caring so much what happened. The characters were somewhat stereotypes and I did not find myself attached to any of them. I feel it may be a matter of personal resonance; for some, this may not matter. I found it a little hard to follow at times and to remember who was who. In my opinion, this could have been resolved by a better relationship with the characters.",

    "review_text": "Keeping in mind I'm someone who has watched movies such as Martyrs and can watch/read crime scene details while keeping a straight head... \n This book was far too disturbing. Basically it felt like the authors wrote these stories merely for shock value. It included things like graphic cannibalism, sexually gratifying murder, pedophila, and extreme perversion all around. Particularly the stories by \"B.C Lawson\" disturbed me and made me wonder if he is actually a perverted serial killer. And who wants their work of fiction to create that worry... \n There were a few stories that stood out from the rest as actually quite well-written. As it's a collection, I can't paint all authors included with the same brush. But I feel it's almost unfortunate for those few authors who have talent and didn't just spew out filth to be included with the rest.",

I did like the main character and feel there is potential, but I feel the author needs to explore either genre more fully; either religious fiction OR horror.

    "review_text": "*Update - 10/27/13* - After some sleep, I thinking about Allegiant overall without the influence of other reviews, I changed my rating to a 2 which is deserved. \n I know that no author is going to please the masses. I had given the first 2 books 5 stars. My ratings were well deserved. Allegiant was written with very little action, jumping on the train one time, which we learn later in the book it is controlled by people in the city and slows down. Blowing up a hole in a wall is not the action a reader wanted, we wanted to see Divergent action. \n I cried with the ending and hoped that the book would have ended differently. No author can keep all the characters. Different plots and bland characters bent on power or revenge make up this book. \n Sometimes authors produce gold and fail to live up the standards of their readers. Veronica spun gold twice and couldn't do it for a third time. \n 10/27/13 Review \n I really wanted to give the book 2 stars but I chose 3 as it did get interesting around chapter 40, but it also felt really drawn out. Allegiant was nothing like Divergent and Insurgent. I read both Divergent and Insurgent 2x. I struggled getting through with Allegiant. For me, I didn't have much of a stronghold to keep reading. A lot of other readers, myself included, felt the first 2 books could have finished the series. I felt a few times that Veronica was grasping on a ending. I still don't see why the book took 18 months to be published. The mix of chapters from Tris to Four was confusing. Four didn't seem to have his character personality as he did in the prior books. Gone Girl did the character transitions from chapter to chapter much smoother. Several times I found myself wondering who's prospective I was reading from. Not to give anything away, read the book if you want to see how the series ends. Don't read the book if you want a complete spin off of the first 2 books and being placed in a Maze Runner setting.",

    "review_text": "** spoiler alert ** \n So many people have said you will laugh and cry reading this book and that's exactly what I did. The Edge of Never did start off slow but give it sometime, the story gets better and better. The last 50 pages you will need tissues. \n I can't wait to see the 2nd book in Andrews POV. \n I cried and cried after I read Andrew's letter to Camryn. The letter was moving and how he could never tell her about how much he loved her. If you don't want to know what the letter says, don't read any further. \n ************************************* \n Andrew's Letter \n Dear Camryn, \n I never wanted it to be this way. I wanted to tell you these things myself, but I was afraid. I was afraid that if I told you out loud that I love you, that what we had together would die with me. The truth is that I knew in Kansas that you were the one. I've loved you since that day when I first looked up into your eyes as you glared down at me from over the top of that bus seat. Maybe I didn't know it then, but I knew something had happened to me in that moment and I could never let you go. \n I have never lived the way I lived during my short time with you. For the first time in my life, I've felt whole, alive, free. You were the missing piece of my soul, the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins. I think that if past lives are real then we have been lovers in ever single one of them. I've known you for a short time, but I feel like I've known you forever. \n I want you to know that even in death I'' always remember you. I'll always love you. I wish that things could've turned out differently. I thought of you many nights on the road. I stared up at the ceiling in the motels and pictured what our life might be like together if I have lived. I even got all mushy and thought of you in a wedding dress and even with a mini me in your belly. You know, I always heard that sex is great when you're pregnant. ;-) \n But I'm sorry that I had to leave you, Camryn. I'm so sorry...I wish the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was real because then you could come to the Underworld and sing me back into your life. I wouldn't look back. I wouldn't fuck it up like Orpheus did. \n I'm so sorry, baby... \n I want you to promise me that you'll stay strong and beautiful and sweet and caring. I want you to be happy and find someone who will love you as much as I did. I want you to get married and have babies and live your life. Just remember to always be yourself and don't be afraid to speak your mind or to dream out loud. \n I hope you'll never forget me. \n One more thing: don't feel bad for not telling me that you loved me. You didn't need to say it. I knew all along that you did. \n Love Always, \n Andrew Parrish",

You see the life of butter from his eyes, how he interacts with his mom and dad, how his so called friends view him, and how his true friend participates in his life. \n It really doesn't matter how old you are, this book brings to life the struggles of childhood, high school, a healthy lifestyle, how others affect ones life, and how one sees themselves in the eyes of everyone around them.",

    "review_text": "I never thought I would enjoy a zombie books with a mix of romance. Amy wrote a beautiful book that is fast paced with a smooth transaction that leaves the reader not wanting to put the book down. This is not a \"eat brains\" type of zombie series. It is more about the lives of people who became undead and how they now live their lives with a mix of love. I wish I would have read this book much sooner, than waiting for over a year after adding the series to my ever growing book list.",

Despite being so well researched and unbiased, it still ends up as engrossing as any novel.",

I was so disappointed by this book, especially after finding out that Mitford was buddies with one of my all time favorites, Evelyn Waugh. That connection, and the recommendation off of I Capture the Castle, had me expecting something more than the stale, perfunctory writing of this by the numbers account of a piece of cardboard of a character. It's a basic, flat account of an uninteresting story. It also takes WAY too long to realize who the story is actually about. It actually takes the narrator saying \"This is Laura's story\" for that to be apparent.",

It reads more like a sensationalized version of events from a trashy gossip magazine. It also settles on one of the least likely solutions to the case and presents it as fact with very little evidence. Read \"A Deed of Death\" instead.",

She can just decide all that at the end like that? What? It felt like nothing was developed and everything was just throw out there like \"sure\" \n I don't know.

I never liked DR too too much but I was really excited for the rising, for chloe and cuz I liked the series, I don't know. But this book honestly wasn't too good... I didn't like the cabals and how they were (WOTOW so much better), the choices (like wut?), and just the ending! \n Fourth, DEREK AND CHLOE WERE COMPLETELY THE BEST PART... but how do I put this.. they seemed really different from DP and I mean I kinda get it but it kinda ruined it for me... \n So.. this book was good, and as much as I want more... more would ruin the whole storyline for me... I think this one was just on the edge:) \n OH AND I LOVED THE CONNECTIONS TO WOTOW, AT EVERYONE I WAS JUMPING UP AND DOWN",

    "review_text": "*CONTAINS SPOILERS* \n I would probably rate this book 1.5 stars out of 5 JUST because of its intense and creepy ass ending. I really did not enjoy how slow this book was until the last 80 pages or so. Amazingly, I got through it after putting this book down several times. \n I've got to admit, I was drawn by the cover. It sounded pretty interesting, but I should've read a couple of pages in before renting it out at the library (glad I didn't pay for this book) because I totally did not know it was set in a high school setting. Blah! I hate those kinds of settings, but that's just my preference. \n As for the plot... Sheesh! Was it really necessary for things to turn out like they did? I was shocked.. What kind of karma is that?! Hell, it really was unfair. I felt that it was a bit.. no, not even.. WAY too cruel for consequences. \n The main character, Em, was pretty relatable which I liked a lot. She wasn't annoying; thank god! The other characters, not-so-likeable. They were quite bland when it came to being a complex character. Chase was just, wow, amazingly arrogant and totally irresponsible. A complete jerk who wouldn't be liable for any of his actions and swathed by the words or beauty of a Fury. Ergh, he had no backbone and I hated that. I enjoyed how Em turned out at the ending of the story and what she went through was PRETTY dang creepy. As I said, I loved the end but I definitely hated having to wait 300 pages until the story got interesting. \n *END RANT* :L",

As mentioned by many, the teenagers spoke like adults. Besides that, which I really didn't mind, this book was \"heart-throbbingly\" depressing but goddamn beautiful.",

    "review_text": "Amazing!! Higginson is now one of my most admired authors. Her extraordinary and captivating imagination portrayed in this book rendered me speechless and at awe. I was a bit hesitant to read this series, but after reading the first book of the series I fell in love with it. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed by reading this series. It was an incredibly written series that was well tied with explanations and beautiful details of the settings. The main characters were dymamic and complex which made the series highly interesting. Purely magical.",

    "review_text": "I was pretty excited for this one but unfortunately... I was pretty disappointed. \n The only part of the book that was interesting for me was the last 100 pages (Nook eBook edition); but that's just me. There were a lot of things going on but it wasn't as intensely mind-blowing like the other books in this series. Unlike the other books in this series (where I was hooked from the beginning to the end) I was struggling to actually finish this book until I reached those last 100 pages. I will admit that I enjoyed how she ended this book and I loved how she made readers think hard about Sebastian and his truthful plans. Besides that, I don't think I gained any new insight to any of the characters besides Simon's way of thinking when it comes to relationships. \n I simply \"liked\" this book, rather than \"loved\" it and it pains me to say it because I love this series. Either way, I still love this series and will read the next :)",

    "review_text": "4.5 I'm-Obsessed Stars!! \n Jessica Hawkins has written an engrossing and emotional romance that I simply couldn't put down! I am obsessed with Lake and Manning. Book #3 is releasing on 10/23 so if you've been waiting to start this series, don't delay! \n \"Ten months. That was how long I'd gone without a fix. Lake's letters came every couple weeks. I'd opened the first one, but that was it. I'd known right then that if I was going to make it through this, I couldn't think of her. Couldn't be inside her head that way, and she definitely couldn't be inside mine.\" \n My heart broke for Lake and Manning. They endured years apart and obstacles at every turn. I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can't wait to find out! \n \"But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake.\" \n This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!! Highly recommend this series for contemporary romance readers. I'm a Jessica Hawkins fan for life!! \n \" I couldn't tell her I loved her. I couldn't tell her I didn't. It killed me, but that was how it was. It wasn't going to be any other way, no matter how many times she put me in this goddamn position.\" \n Favorite quote: \n \"Maybe one day, Manning and I would challenge fate, defy gravity, and move the stars ourselves. But today was not that day.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars!! \n \"Was sixteen too young to fall in love? I might've thought so before Manning. Could he love me back, a man seven years older? I was sure if he did, he'd never admit it. But I would wait for him. Even I understood that for a while, our ages mattered.\" \n As a longtime fan of Jessica Hawkins, I just knew I would love this book. And from the very first page, I was totally hooked. What a delight! A slow-burn, forbidden romance. My favorite! \n This is the kind of book where the author takes her time describing a first meeting, a small moment, a conversation. Nothing is simply told, it is shown. I flew through this book, absolutely breathless with anticipation at what would happen next! \n Lake and Tiffany are two sisters who both meet Manning at the same time. There's just one problem: Lake is only 16 years old. And Manning is a handsome construction worker with a past. \n He half-smiled, one corner of his mouth lifting. That was the first I saw of his straight, white teeth. My heart skipped. Under the dirt, the sweat, the calluses, he was handsome. I'd known it already, peripherally, as I knew the direction of the beach or the artwork hanging in my dad's office. But now it was right in front of me. I couldn't miss it.\" \n Lake is a good girl: smart, studious and obedient. Tiffany is the wild child. But the interactions with their parents are nuanced and there is more to them than their labels. Although Tiffany seems flighty, she is much more appropriate for Manning than Lake. But who will get his heart? \n \"Manning leaned his elbows onto his knees and watched her approach. My sister had that effect on men. They were always looking over or around me to see her. What'd he think when he looked at her? What'd he notice first?\" \n I rarely have time to read a series back to back. But this book was so gripping and intense that I am immediately picking up the next book! I am obsessed with these characters and their story! \n \"Some invisible tether existed between us. Nobody could see it, not even us, but I felt it. I was sure Manning did, too. As long as we both knew it, that was enough for me. For now, at least.\" \n Highly recommend this one. It has great pacing, a real setting and a gripping story. Don't miss it!! \n \"It was a promise. No matter what, the story would only ever be about us.",

    "review_text": "4.5 EPIC STARS!! \n OMG what do I read now?! My heart is FILLED with Lake and Manning. A truly epic and passionate series. A must-read! \n \"You wanted me to move on, so I did, and I no longer need you. You can't have it both ways.\" \n All the love to Jessica Hawkins for crafting an unforgettable and heart-wrenching love story. This series spans decades and is truly one of my favorite contemporary romance sagas ever. Lake and Manning have an emotional connection that is stunning, heartbreaking and simply beautiful. \n How to write a review that is completely spoiler-free? Just know that this series kept me up many nights reading because I just had to know how Lake and Manning's epic journey was going to end. From two completely different worlds, these two only ever needed each other. Even if real life constantly got in their way. \n \"I didn't know it would turn out this way, Lake. Your life, and mine, nothing is how I thought it would be.\" \n I literally read the books in this series back to back, and honestly had no clue where the author would take me as a reader. Ms. Hawkins stayed true to her main characters and developed the secondary characters perfectly. Dare I say that Tiffany was misunderstood? And that I would love to see a story based around her as well as Corbin? (But not together!) But this is Manning and Lake's story and I lived and breathed them for every page of this gorgeous story. Angst, joy, true love, heartbreak, despair - this series has it all and then some. \n \"These are the pieces, and they might not look like much to you, but they're all I have. I've found a way to be happy. You can't come back into my life and tell me it's a mess when you're the one who created it.\" \n Manning is one of THE sexiest and most unforgettable main characters I've ever read. The self-sacrifice and heartache he endures is almost unbearable! And I literally felt as if I was THERE during the New York City scenes. \n \"I thought I'd never have you, Lake, you have to understand that. I thought there was no chance. That people like me didn't get a life like this.\" \n Jessica Hawkins doesn't take any shortcuts and it shows in her writing. Nothing in this series felt rushed, forced or left undone. Every event felt necessary and fit perfectly. This is not an easy story to read - there is heartache, cheating, and tons of angst - but it was gripping and completely satisfying. If you love an adult, very sexy story with real depth and brutal honesty, then don't miss this series. And now I might actually have to do a re-read! \n \"You and me, we're you and me. Nobody's earned the right to know our story.\"",

    "review_text": "RACER EFFING TATE!! \n Katy Evans is back, doing what she does best! 'Real' fans will swoon because Remy and Brooke's little boy Racer is all grown up! That being said, this hot sports romance is a standalone so you can still enjoy this book even if you haven't read any of the books in the series. \n Lana's family's racing team is in desperate need of a driver. It's up to Lana to prove herself to her father and her brothers to find the best driver there is for their team. Chance leads her to Racer, famous in the world of illegal street racing. He's simply the best. \n Lana takes a huge risk and hates Racer for her formula race car team. I loved the fast-paced description of the world of racing! Traveling all over the world for the races, Lana can hardly resist Racer, when he sets his sights on her and decides she's The One for him. \n \"This is illegal,\" I state. \n His voice is husky from exertion, and his eyes glint with laughter. \"That's why it's fun.\" \n Lana has a very protective family and a very sad past. But Racer Tate isn't going to let anything stop him. He also has a lot of secrets he's keeping, ones that will not only threaten his relationship with Lana but also his racing career. Will Lana and Racer be able to survive and overcome the obstacles that are in their way? \n One of the things I love about Katy Evans is how she creates sexual tension with her characters. And it is off the charts here! Racer is intense on and off the racetrack, and Lana doesn't stand a chance! \n \"Crasher ...\" He warns, sounding a little cocky. \"You go out with me and you'll never look back. I swear, baby.\" \n I enjoyed this sexy, passionate story very much. There is low angst so if you are in the mood for a sizzling sports romance with wit and crackling sexual chemistry, then you will LOVE Racer!! And fans of the 'Real' series will adore the way the cherished characters make appearances here. Happy reading! \n \"I'm Racer Tate and this girl is mine.",

    "review_text": "\"You're the queen. I'm just a commoner. \n GAH!!! MY HEART!!! This book was everything. One of the best-second chance romances I've ever read. \n Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. \n \"You don't know this, but that girl? She doesn't need a house. She doesn't even need an apartment. She would've slept in the car. She wouldn't have complained at all about it. You didn't have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She's worried, and she's scared, that this won't be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn't be there if she didn't. But the world isn't always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive.\" \n Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. \n \"I don't deserve her time, not in the least, but I'm so desperate for some part of this woman back that I'll steal every second that I can get.\" \n Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging. I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison! The book is heartbreaking, sexy, funny, heartfelt and completely uplifting. \n \"Whatever did it, I'm glad you're sober, and I hope you stay that way. For Maddie's sake, yeah, because she deserves to know her dad, but for your sake, too. I know I was never enough for you, Jonathan, but I hope you find something that is.\" \n This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroine's point of view. I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love. There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story. This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end. I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and self-sufficient. She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions. She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams. \n \"Wherever it takes you, I'll be there. \n 'Ghosted' is another must-read book from JM Darhower. One of my favorite books of the year. \n \"Thank you, K.\" \n \"What are you thanking me for?\" \n \"Giving me a second chance,\" he says. \"And a third, and a forth, and a fifth...\" \n \"And a twentieth.\" He laughs lightly. \"And a twentieth.\" \n \"There won't be a twenty-first,\" I tell him. \"I have to draw the line somewhere.\"",

I want to live in blissful denial.\" \n I am not a fan of over-the-top drama or crazy plots. So imagine my delight when I read 'Fallen Heir' almost in one sitting! Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. \n Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. \n \"I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don't-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend.\" \n This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton's story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! \n \"I'm the only one here, drinking crap I can't stand because I don't want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head's a bad, bad place.\" \n I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. 'Fallen Heir' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. \n \"I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don't move I'm gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you.\" \n I crack up. \"The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty.\" \n \"I'm thinking everything sounds dirty to you,\" she says dryly.\" \n This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you're looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story. \n \"I'm the design flaw in the Royal family, the one who isn't quite like the others, the one who crashes and burns more often than not.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "3.5 - 4 Stars \n \"Loving another gives them power, it can be beautiful, fulfilling and as easy as breathing, but if I lose it again, it will destroy me.\" \n I think we all have a celebrity crush (or two!) For Heather, that person is Eli Walsh. She's loved him from afar ever since he was in a famous boy band. Heather has the chance to see him in concert and for just one night, she decides to let loose and forget the harsh realities of her day-to-day life. In a one-in-a-million chance, Eli notices her in the audience! They spend a fantastic evening together but Heather literally runs away. She has a lot on her plate and is a little embarrassed by what happened with Eli. \n What could ever come out of a one-night stand with a rock star? Especially with Eli, who has a reputation as a playboy. Heather is very real, very grounded and very wary of men. She's recently divorced and because of her ex-husband, has terrible self-esteem. But Eli is intrigued! \n Heather is devoted to her sister and doesn't have the time or emotion to devote to chasing a fantasy. Even though Eli and his band played a huge part in her life when she was younger, she cannot truly believe that someone like Eli would be interested in her. I loved how hard Eli worked to connive Heather that she was beautiful and sexy and deserving of his attention! \n \"She's something completely different. For the first time, I don't have someone chasing me because of who I am.\" \n I love a good story about real-life people with real-life problems and real jobs. There are no billionaires here, just a rock star with a heart and a real woman with great friends and real heartache in her life. I didn't totally feel the connection between the main characters BUT I still very much enjoyed the story. Corinne Michaels fans will love this book. If you are in the mood for a little bit of fantasy, some raunchy humor and a good, old-fashioned happily-ever-after, then you'll love this story. \n \"We can't worry about tomorrow, we can only own tonight\". \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"I'm ready for forever now.\" \n \"I'm ready for forever too,\" she whispers back. \n WELL. Many thoughts on this one. Really FANTASTIC erotic scenes and overall I liked it. If menage is your jam, you will love this series. I absolutely tore through the first two books in this series and could not wait for the conclusion! \n Many readers adored this third book which is mainly Ash's point of view. I'm still not quite sure what to say other than I was not really prepared for the turn of events that occurred in this story. Yes I LOVED the characters but some of the events seemed a little too fantastical for me. \n The writing is complex and well-done and I loved the play on the King Arthur legend. At its heart this is the story of forbidden love and Greer, Embry and Ash are characters that I won't soon forget. \n Sierra Simone took the famous legend of King Arthur and put her own sexy, passionate spin on the legendary characters. There is betrayal, love, passion and heartbreak - this series has it all. \n American Prince ended on a heartbreaking cliffhanger but I absolutely loved how the author continued this storyline into Ash's book. These three are clearly destined to be together and I could not accept any other conclusion to their story! \n \"What am I supposed to do? When the man who is supposed to love me hates me? When I can't protect the woman we both love?\" \n So many forces conspire to pull Ash, Greer and Embry apart. But they simply could not live without each other. This book was filled with surprises and all in all, I loved this series. These books were stunning and sexy and highly erotic. There's lots and lots of kink but the series is very intelligent and very readable. Highly recommend for all erotic romance readers! \n \"I see the beginning. \n And I see the end.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "JB Salsbury is my go-to author for sweet and sexy Alpha heroes and The Final Fight did not disappoint!! I absolutely adored this story and read it in one sitting. Passionate and funny and sexy and heartfelt. Don't miss this fabulous conclusion to the Fighting Series!! \n Back to Las Vegas, the Final Fight does not so much focus on the fighting world as it does on the experiences of our war heroes. All of my favorite characters make an appearance though and the way the author ties everything together was incredibly satisfying. \n AJ is pursuing her dreams of headlining as an acrobatic dancer in a Las Vegas show. For now, she's just one of the performers in a Cirque du Soleil-type show. But she dreams big. And nothing and no one will deter her from her dreams. \n A Vegas casino is like its own planet--a virtually inescapable planet without obvious exit points. The sun or moon never makes an appearance, so the essence of time is completely lost. People are always milling about, and if it weren't for the coffee and pastry cart that opens at dawn and shuts down at noon, it would be impossible to tell morning from night. \n Braeden is only in town for a short time on military leave. He is instantly drawn to AJ's wit and beauty and drive. He is not interested in a long-term commitment because he knows he can be shipped out anytime. I loved when these two met because they are both funny, driven and just very REAL. \n \"You think too much.\" He angles his upper body toward me, opening his chest and torso for my viewing pleasure. Not that seeing him is pleasurable. It's not that; it's . . . he clearly works out or he was blessed with fantastic genes. Not that I'm noticing. Or care. Whatever. \n I really felt their intense connection which is SO important for me. Their chemistry is scorching hot but more than that, they share an emotional connection. Even though they both try to deny it. \n \"I don't need promises. I only want to live in this moment with you, whatever that means, and not think about tomorrow or a week or a year from now.\" \n Circumstances and a series of miscommunications lead to Braeden and AJ being separated. JB Salsbury added just the right amount of angst so that the story moved forward but never felt forced. And can I say that I really liked AJ's boss, Andre? I felt that he was a little misunderstood and I can definitely feel another story there! \n Braeden and AJ both have to overcome tragedy and curveballs thrown in their way. But their story is ultimately uplifting and inspiring and very, very emotional. Braeden especially was SO inspiring. \n \"You'll be okay. We're going to get through this. We're gonna fight our way through this because we know no other way. And we're gonna do it together.\" \n Fans of the Fighting Series will LOVE how this series ends. 'The Final Fight' is fast-paced, sexy and funny in all the right places. I loved Braeden and AJ and their inspiring journey. \n \"I will die before I let you go, you hear me? You'll be back. You'll be fighting for this shit too, but until you're there, until you get your fight back, I'm fighting for you.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"I promise to love you forever. As long as there is love in this world, we will be a part of it.\" \n So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it. \n Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. \n I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. \n \"You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?\" \n \"No, but are you going to paint it?\" \n \"Paint what?\" \n \"Us, what we just did?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"No?\" \n \"No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred.\" \n The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. \n Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? \n It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. \n This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! \n \"I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time.\" \n \"You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?\" \n \"Love, Charlotte.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 Kinky Stars!! \n Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! \n \"Everyone is weird, Kate, we're the perfect kind of weird for each other.\" \n Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. \n \"Her obsession wasn't even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. \n But she thinks Ty can't stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she's actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. \n \"Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? \n This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn't believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* \n Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. \n \"Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology, wanting to cherish her was something else. Something much worse. \n This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes. Eve Dangerfield is fearless! And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was. \n Ty glared at her. \"Think you're funny, don't you, Middleton?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Well we'll see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire.\" \n This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there. Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea, then do not read this one. BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink, as I am, then by all means read 'Act Your Age'! It is pure, growly Alpha-male goodness through and through. I can't wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next! \n What he and Middleton shared had gravity, it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"Out of all the places we could be, we're right here. At the same time.\" \n Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in 'Without Merit'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. \n \"I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. \n Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. \n Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin's boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. \n Merit is angry and surly and can't seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? \n \"I'm confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor's boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they're perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. \n Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family's past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover's characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. \n \"Sagan just doesn't say mean things out loud. Maybe that's a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he's some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals.\" \n I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here. \n \"Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing a mistake deserves is forgiveness.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "Bey's kiss wasn't my first, but it was the only one that mattered. \n Totally and utterly addictive, this duet blew me away. You must read book one (Maldeamores) first because this is the continuation of Lucky and Bey's story. To say that the first book ended on a cliffhanger is a slight understatement, but book two flawlessly flows right into the next chapters in the Lucky and Bey's lives. \n Mara White is a master at writing taboo romance. She draws you into the main characters' hearts and minds and makes you FEEL their heartache, love and pain. This story is told in alternating points of view and alternates between the past and the present. Thus more is revealed about the angst and love and heartache that Lucky and Belen felt as they fell irrevocably in love with each other as children. \n Biology causes our attraction and it's also the reason we have to stay apart. But it's the fate which worries me the most, and that I can't get a handle on. It is the physics of our love that disagrees with the universe. \n Lucky and Belen suffered SO much I wasn't sure how Mara White would ever manage to give them the happy ending they deserved. Reading a book by Mara White is often like being on an emotional roller-coaster and I wasn't 100% certain where this ride would end! But her wonderfully rich and descriptive writing made this a book I simply couldn't put down. \n \"I like your kind of trouble, Luciano,\" Bey says. She lays her mouth on my forearm in the ghost of a kiss. Arrows with poison flaming tips shoot down my limbs. \n \"Don't say things like that, Len. You have no idea what you're getting into.\" \n \"I'm not afraid,\" she says and it's barely a whisper. \n \"You should be,\" I say. I am. \n I loved seeing Lucky and Bey as adults and read this book in one sitting. Highly recommend this duet for all fans of forbidden romance!! \n Stay like this, Bey. Close to my heart forever.",

    "review_text": "\"This is just the start, baby.\" \n Mamas, raise your boys to grow up like Asa. Holy hot single dad!! If bossy Alpha males are your jam, you'll LOVE 'Gifts'! I'm still sobbing from the Epilogue. Highly recommend! \n This book has the elusive \"it\" factor that makes my heart race and my eyes tear up. Between laughing out loud. Oh and also it features a hot single dad who's over 40 and a 35 year old heroine with two children. This is my favorite book of the 'Killers' series but it can totally be read as a standalone. Jump right in and meet Brynne Asher!! This author NEEDS to be on your radar!! \n This book had it all for me. Possessive Alpha, a smart and feisty heroine, real-life situations and very sweet and touching moments. If you love contemporary romance, you will LOVE this book!! Keelie was especially funny and very relatable. \n \"I have a date. \n Tonight. \n At five o'clock. \n Am I that old that I have to go on a date at five o'clock? Thirty-five is not old. Who the hell is she fixing me up with that wants to go on a date at five o'clock? I know it's been forever since I've been on a date, but five o'clock is for senior citizens--not women in their mid-thirties. \n I'm ready to write off my first attempt at getting back into the game after more than a decade. I've decided the game sucks and I will be pleased as punch to sit on the sidelines. Others can go watch Netflix and fuck themselves for all I care.\" \n I absolutely LOVED Asa! He is raising two teenagers and has retired from his former very dangerous life. He doesn't have time to beat around the bush! He meets Keelie and in true Alpha fashion, makes his intentions very clear. \n \"Keelie?\" Her brows pucker under the bill of her blue baseball hat. \"Hmm?\" \n I lower my voice. \"We're adults. I don't need to date to know what I want.\" \n Did I mention that I loved Asa? He adores his kids but his daughter Emma is having a very rough time in high school. Only later does Asa find out the reason why. Keelie also has her hands full, with a full-time job, young children and a house filled with animals. But Asa accepts it all. \n I lean in and we're as close as we've been all night. \"You date someone to figure out what you want. I know what I want and I think you do, too. It's the gift of life, Keelie. We just need to embrace it.\" \n Asa moves quickly in all things and when he sees an opportunity to be closer to Kellie and her family, he takes it. Keel's first husband was a great father but a terrible partner and she has trust issues, to put it mildly. \n \"I have to warn you. I was using my kids as an excuse. You have to know that I'm a bit of a mess. More than a bit really. I'm just ... I don't know ...\" I sigh. \"Fucked up.\" \n He presses his hips into my stomach and I feel the long, hard length of his cock when he smiles down at me. \"Is it too soon to want to unfuck you by fucking you?\" \n There's a very fast-paced storyline that's reminiscent of the Rock Chick series but at the heart of it all is the relationship between Keelie and Asa. This is a very witty, very sexy read that will satisfy every romance reader! I just loved these two together and actually cried at the Epilogue. Don't miss this one! 'Gifts' is romance at its best. \n Favorite quote: \n Touching a man for the first time in what seems like an eternity. My heart strums as his breath feathers across my face. \n Oxygen. \n Heartbeats. \n Life. \n But more than all that combined... \n Trust. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "Okay SO...this is the first book I have read in this series and I can honestly say that is can be read as a complete standalone! Often I am reluctant to read a book that is part of a series BUT the author does a great job of filling in the stories of the whole Lund clan. \n Loved the premise of this book! Jensen Lund is a pro football and has firm dating rules. No single mothers, no cheerleaders AND no medical professionals. He is a football superstar who has been sidelined by an injury, and is recovering from surgery. Rowan Michaels is a beautiful single mom who also happens to be a professional cheerleader AND who also works in the field of athletic training!! The complete opposite of everything that Jensen thinks he needs. \n Rowan is smart, tough and very professional. She has rules, too, like NEVER dating professional athletes. She is raising her young son on her own and has zero interest in men like Jensen. Excerpt that once she gets to know him, she realizes that he is smart, sensitive and driven - just like her. There is one big obstacle to their relationship, though - the football team has a very strict no-franternization rule between players and cheerleaders. \n Rowan and Jensen both live the same apartment complex so they are neighbors. Hard to avoid each other, right? I loved that there was no insta-love here, but instead Rowan and Jensen's relationship was allowed to build and grow throughout the book. Ms. James is an incredible writer and she really created a wonderful story with these characters. I loved the slow-build romance between these two. And Rowan's adorable son added some light-hearted moments to the story. \n Will Rowan and Jensen sacrifice their friendship for their professional careers? I adored the conclusion to this story! And the Lund family was captivating. This book is also super-sexy and has enticed me to start the other books in the series. A definite must-read for all contemporary romance lovers! \n \"Ask me why I stayed away this week.\" \n \"Why did you stay away this week?\" \n \"Because I'm a shitty friend.\" \n \"Why are you a shitty friend?\" \n \"Because I don't want to be friends with you.

I fell in love with Vi Keeland's writing with \"Worth the Fight' a few years ago, and 'Beautiful Mistake' highlights the BEST of her talents!! Sexxxxy romance, relatable characters, a great story...and a twist that I never saw coming. \n I have read so many student/teacher stories lately but this book is SO much more!! Caine is a music professor and Rachel is his graduate student Teaching Assistant. I absolutely loved the them of music that ran through the book. How does music make you feel? What memories does music bring back for the listener? But this story is much more than the taboo relationship between Caine and Rachel. Both have secrets that are very slowly revealed through the book. How will those secrets affect their relationship? \n Rachel has had a tough life and she is one feisty character! Funny. beautiful, kind and loving, she has made her share of mistakes but can't resist Caine's sex appeal. The dialogue is smart, light where it needs to be and the supporting characters are perfect. \n \"Calm down in there. He isn't inviting you to a romantic dinner. He only wants you to help with his nieces. Put on a diaper, not take off your clothes.\" \n I was surprised by the depth and emotion in this story. Rachel and Caine's story will stay with me for a long time. Bravo, Ms. Keeland. Highly recommend 'Beautiful Mistake'!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "3.5 - 4 Stars \n \"It would've been romantic if I wasn't drunk as a skunk when I dialed him.\" \n I am a die-hard Penelope Ward fan. I DEVOUR her books. And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon's family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. \n However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. \n Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn't quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward's main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! \n His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. \n 'Drunk Dial' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. \n Our story was a lot like a Rubik's Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together. \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "If you love a sweet, verrrry sexy, low-angst romance, then this is the book for you! Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet super-hot contemporary romance. \n Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. \n There's tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What's not to love? After an embarrassing \"meet cute\" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It's not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. \n The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There's not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn't want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. \n \"The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I'd masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate.\" \n This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo. \n \"It's proof you hooked me from the very beginning, luv.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "3.5 Stars \n This was my first book by Jeannine Colette and I really enjoyed it! Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. \n Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam's best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. \n Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam's supervision, the sparks begin to fly. \n Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan's early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! \n Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn't just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. 'Wrecked' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours. \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "4 - 4.5 Stars!! \n \"If I ever lay eyes on you again... I can't promise I'll do what's best and walk away next time...\" \n Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? 'The Forbidden' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that \"spark\" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. \n Jack's marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. \n \"I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack's my life. He's my pulse. He's everything.\" \n This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it! \n \"I'm in hell and I'm in heaven. I'm flying and I'm drowning.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that's for sure - he's totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. \n They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew's daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. \n Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it's not enough to scare me away. In fact, it's the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. \n The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. \n \"I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can't handle it another second.\" \n I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew's relationship grew and developed. This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I can't wait to read what's next!! \n \"Have I ever mentioned how it feels when I'm the reason for your smile? Like a million bucks.\" \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

This book is not what I expected and the author reveals Andy's complex character here. Don't miss this conclusion to the Rock and Roll Series.

    "review_text": "\"Grabbing a bite. With a twenty-year-old. From a boy band. Under what circumstance might that ever be construed as acceptable?\" \n I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. \n A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, 'The Idea of You' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee's first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! \n Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous \"boy band\". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene's relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. \n Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as \"just lunch\" soon becomes much, much more. \n \"I just want to look at you for a moment.\" \n \"You've been looking at me for over an hour.\" \n \"Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here.\" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. \n Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn't Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband's reaction to the news but also with her daughter's. \n The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole. Face-first. \n One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity. Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed, and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene. He was used to it; Solene was not. This story made me re-think every headline I read about celebrities. Hayes wanted Solene to know him, and NOT \"the idea\" of him. Hayes was tender, sweet, funny, sexy and much wiser than his 20 years. \n \"You want to be kissed, Solene?\" His hands were in my hair, pushing it off of my face, cradling my neck. \n \"Yes.\" I nodded. \n \"You think you can handle that?\" \n \"I'll see what I can do.\" \n Robinne Hill gets her locations right. From Miami, to Malibu, to Manhattan and Paris, I felt as if I was THERE, experiencing the cafes, the clubs, the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts. This book really checked all the boxes for me!! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. I am having a hard time moving on from this book. Would I love a sequel? YES. But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms. Hill. Grab 'The Idea of You' and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read. I adored it. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"You're making me blush,\" he laughed, tipping his head back. His jawline from this angle was well-defined, exquisite, like art. His beauty, like a gift that kept revealing itself. \n \"Love,\" she said, \"was not always perfect, and not exactly how you expected it to be. But when it descended upon you, there was no controlling it.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "4 - 4.5 Stars!! \n OMG!! Refreshing, smart, fun and swoony, I LOVED this book!! It was just what I needed. My favorite R.S. Grey book since 'Scoring Wilder'. If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! \n Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) \n They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam's nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! \n \"No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal.\" \n \"Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do.\" \n \"That's when I thought you'd be asking me for a lung or something!\" \n \"So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?\" \n \"Don't try to be cute.\" \n Adam's family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn't be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. \n \"And you brought cookies?\" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. \n \"Freshly baked this morning,\" I brag. \n She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who's following us into the house with Mouse by his side. \"I love her already!\" \n I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I've had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I'll date Adam's mom? \n 'The Foxe & the Hound\" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat. I loved the banter, the characters and the charming small-town Texas setting. I swear, R.S. Grey could be a TV comedy writer, that's how funny her dialogue is!! \n \"I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights, but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago. Instead, I'm forced to stand, hang up on Daisy, and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand. We're the first two to arrive. She takes her usual spot beside Helen's chair, and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table. Her perfume is strong. Chanel number five, she told me once, bragging. Oh really? On you it smells like a number two. \n This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach. I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton, Texas. Bravo, Ms. Grey!! Keep writing more books like this one. \n \"We should slow down,\" I sputter just before his mouth falls to my chest. \n He swirls his tongue around my nipple and my eyes pinch closed. Or, y'know, speed up even more.",

    "review_text": "3.5 - 4 stars \n Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spin-off from the Nine Minutes series. Lots of unexpected twists and turns! \n I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony's early life. \n I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen! \n Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. \n He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. \n Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. \n Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book! \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

And please don't read any spoilers! The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS! \n Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC's EVER. Strong, funny, self-deprecating, she is basically just waiting for her life to begin. She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position she's in. But there is so much more to her story!! \n \"If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery.\" \n This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything. \n \"Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot. She lived a hundred yards away. \n This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL. I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters. It is another delightfully different story from one of the best indie authors writing today. Pick up 'When Life Happened.' You will be delighted and challenged and entertained. \n The truth doesn't always set you free, and lies are not always deception. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 Darkly Delicious Stars!!! \n Adult, sexy and daring. Brianna Hale gets better and better. \n \"His singing voice can rattle windows with fury or caress with love.\" \n Ahhhhh....Frederic. Each hero of Brianna Hale strikes all the right notes with me. Having devoured her first two books, I could not wait to read 'Soft Limits.' A little darker than her previous books, this story has a little more depth and seriousness and I absolutely could not put it down! There are certain authors I just \"click\" with and Ms. Hale is one of them. You can count on tons of kink, flawless writing and a superb storyline. And a happy ending! Always. \n If you have been wanting to try a little daddy/little girl kink, then by all means get your feet wet with Brianna Hale. I adored Evie and loved her exploration of her darker side. A brilliant writer in her won right, she has always searched for something more....and she finds it with Frederic D'Estang. \n \"It's not just that I like make-believe. I crave it. And lately, I crave make-believe about villains most of all.\" \n Evie is tasked with writing Frederic's biography. He is a famous performer and is hiding a dark secret of his own, Slowly they begin to get to know each other and realize that they have an almost unbreakable bond. They share the same unusual desires and fit each other perfectly. One thing i love about Brianna Hale's books is that there is no shame involved with her characters - everything is explored in a heathy and safe way. And I loved the age difference between Evie and Frederic! \n \"There are a few reasons someone might be a hero, but there are infinite reasons to be a villain.\" \n There is a slightly gothic feel to this book which sets it apart from the earlier books. All set in London, the city plays a vital role in Ms. Hale's books. I loved the lush descriptions of the city and of the countryside. I promise that once you pick this book up, you won't be bale to put it down! And there's plenty of lightness to balance out the darker elements. All in all, a wonderfully sexy, very adult love story. Highly recommend! \n \"Frederic isn't afraid of my vulnerability, he craves it.\" \n ARC provided in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "From the book cover, to the story, to the ending, I absolutely adored this book! I rarely have time to binge read anymore but I read this book right after finishing 'Little Dancer'. Something about Ms. Hale's writing just clicks with me. \n Dieter is hired as a bodyguard to protect Adrienne in the wake of a very public scandal involving her father. She does not agree to this arrangement, and fights both her father and Dieter at every turn. \n A dominant Alpha, Dieter is former SAS and will do anything to protect the sassy Adrienne. The writing in this story is strong, the scenes between Dieter and his \"principal\" hotter than hot, and the London setting is perfect. \n A total guilty pleasure from beginning to end, this book is hotter than hell with a fabulous HEA. I can't wait for Ms. Hale's next book!! \n ... \n Favorite quotes: \n ... \n Dieter leans down and whispers in my ear and his voice is silkier, more dangerous than ever. \"Don't ask for things, little girl, if you're not prepared for the consequences.\" \n ... \n I've relinquished some control over to him and I...like it? I think about his hands wrapped around my wrists or my throat, and a hot sensation chases through my body. \n I'm attracted to my bodyguard. \n ... \n \"It's a goddamn miracle,\" he mutters, his hands roving over my skin, \"that I haven't given you the spanking of your life, all the lip you've given me.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "4.5 Captivating Stars!!! \n \"When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie.\" \n -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko \n 'The Child's is a haunting and emotional character-driven suspense novel that also explores our modern-day obsession with 24/7 news. \n Angela's newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier. The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. \n Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author's previous book 'The Widow' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate's style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. \n \"I've always thought that's a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don't they?\" \n Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the \"Building Site Baby' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela's family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. \n The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. \n 'The Child' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. \n There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. \n \"People say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn't. It breaks your bones, leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape. Creaking along the fault lines, Fragile and exhausting to hold together. Sometimes you wish it had killed you.\" \n (With thanks to the publisher for a review copy.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 \"Yes, Daddy\" Stars!! \n WELL, HELLO!! Welcome to the judgment-free zone! If you are just the tiniest bit curious about the DDlg genre (that's \"Daddy Dom/little girl\"), then please enjoy this absolutely delicious confection by Brianna Hale. I read this book in a few hours and it was one of the most heart-warming, sexy, taboo and romantic stories I've ever read. \n Abby is a young dancer who comes alive when onstage. She can barely cope with the realities of day-to-day life, but feels completely at ease when she is dancing at the Palais Theatre. Still living with her parents, she is shy, innocent and very inexperienced. \n When I'm onstage, and all there is, is the music and the sweet burn of exertion and the glare of the hot lights, I'm me. \n Imagine Abby's surprise (and delight!) when the handsome, stern and very bossy theatre owner Rufus Kingsolver takes an interest in her. \n Oh boy. Mr. Kingsolver. He is good at reading people and he knows just what Abby needs. This book should come with a warning label because it is that hot. Abby finally feels that someone understands her and all of her odd habits. She acts like a little girl in many ways, because it soothes and comforts her, and she is PERFECT for Rufus! \n \"It's such a relief to know that there are other people like me. I'm not strange, or weird, or stupid. \n THIS BOOK. I loved it! I thoroughly enjoyed every word. Please pay attention to book description and if it turns you off, do not read this. But if you love a hot, quick read, this is the book for you. I was fascinated by the Daddy Dom world and also the way in which Abby grew as a person over the course of the story. \n He strokes his thumb over my cheek and it comes away glittery. I'm dropping glitter all over him. \"I missed you, little one.\" \n \"I'm so sorry I caused us so much pain and I said Persephone and I wasn't brave enough.\" \n \"You're the bravest person I know, babygirl. Look at all that you've done.\" He pulls a tissue out of his pocket and wipes my tears, and then puts it over my nose. \"Blow.\" I do. The tissue comes away glittery, too. \n \"I'm getting glitter all over you,\" I say with a shaky laugh. \n He presses his forehead against mine. \"Please get glitter all over me,\" he whispers. \"Drown me in it.\" \n There are BDSM elements in this story but it is surprisingly romantic and tender. I loved it so much that I am diving right into the next book by Ms. Hale, Princess Brat. Because sometimes you just need to escape with a few hours of fun, sexy fantasy! \n \"Yes. But what I want isn't important. It's your body and your decision.\"",

    "review_text": "\"This woman could be my downfall. Could make me forget who I am. All I am.\" \n Jodi Ellen Malpas at her best! Drew's story is perfect for fans of The Lord Jesse but any romance lover will absolutely devour this steamy short story. \n Drew is one of the group of Jesse Ward's best friends from the 'This Man' trilogy. He is a devoted father to young Georgia and the very successful head of a London real estate agency. Since Jesse closed The Manor, Drew must go elsewhere to have fun.. He is most definitely NOT looking for a lasting relationship. His daughter and his business come first. \n Raya is only interested in an emotionless, no-strings-attached session. But Drew is unlike anyone she's ever met and once he's been with Raya, Drew cannot stop thinking about her. \n Anything more would give away this fun and sexy and engaging novella. This story is really not a standalone and probably should only be read and enjoyed after reading the 'This Man' series. \n I LOVED Drew's interactions with Jesse and Ava and the whole crew from 'This Man'. This novella is funny, HOT and perfect for readers wishing for more from this fantastic series of books. Thank you Ms. Malpas! Adored this juicy short story. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "SOOOO sweet and hot!!! I ADORE second-chance romances and 'The Lucky Heart' is a PERFECT example of this genre done right!! Devney Perry has become an auto-read author for me. I love her blend of sweet, sexy, Alphas and compulsively readable storylines with a bit of suspense thrown in. \n \"This time around, I didn't want her running to me as an escape. This time around, I wanted her to finally choose me just because I made her happy. \" \n While the other characters from the earlier books make appearances here, this book can be read and enjoyed as a complete standalone. Felicity is back in her Montana hometown after many years away. She is a former \"mean girl\" who is trying her best to make amends with her family and friends. A terrible, life-altering tragedy occurred when she was a young woman and she is determined to seek forgiveness from all who were affected by her actions. \n Silas has always loved Felicity, but she broke his heart when she left town suddenly. Can I just say: OMG SILAS!!!! Devney Perry creates THE sweetest, sexiest, HOTTEST Alpha heroes!! Silas is hard-working, loving, loyal and kind but tough when he needs to be. Felicity broke his heart once, but he is not going to let her go again. And he won't let anyone disrespect her, either. \n \"Now that she was back in Montana, I wasn't letting her go. I'd play it slow and steady. Put in the time. But one day she'd be mine. \n Just like she was always meant to be. \n Silas and Felicity have a complex relationship. There are a lot of external forces working against them. I loved watching a trust and friendship develop between them. This is just a gorgeous story, filled with scenes from a working ranch, life in Montana and even the dangers of addiction. This is a big, beautiful story, much like how I imagine life in small-town Montana to be! \n \"I love that you get all shy when I give you a compliment,\" he said into my hair. \"But don't hide that smile from me, Lis. I live for it.\" \n There's plenty of action in this story and excellent character-building. I adore Devney Perry's writing style and can't wait for the next story in this series. Plus, I am a sucker for a good Epilogue and this one was PERFECT \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "Such a sweet and sexy story! Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. \n I'm a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse's friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It's no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. \n \"Nick?\" Gigi asked, but I didn't speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. \n \"Sorry. I have to go,\" she mumbled before racing to the door. \n \"What was that? Do you know her?\" Jess asked. \n Yeah. I knew her. \"She's my wife.\" \n There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there's a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. \n Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn't know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the \"wow\" factor that 'The Coppersmith Farmhouse' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. \n I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. 'The Clover Chapel' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word. I am thrilled that the third book in the series, 'The Lucky Heart' is coming in August! I can't wait to return to Jamison Valley. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"Now I know how much there is to be afraid of and it terrifies me. But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?\" \n This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! \n \"Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn't die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better.\" \n John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. \n \"You're here?\" \n \"Yeah.\" \n \"Why?\" \n \"Because this is where you are,\" he said, as if it were obvious. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 \"Big Red\" Stars!! \n OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. \n \"You're stunning,\" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. \n \"Thanks.\" \n Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. \n Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! \n He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\" \n Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. \n \"You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?\" \n Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has \"it.\" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened.\" \n \"They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost \n c--t.'\" \n \"You're my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close.\"",

'Broken Bay' is a fast-paced, modern tale about a group of old friends who gather for a bachelorette weekend. Even though this is a short story, the characters are all well-developed and the setting quite detailed. And the cover is perfect!! Throw in an old ghost story and some old secrets, and you have a heady cocktail about friendship, loyalty and love.

    "review_text": "\"He was so addictive. Like candy. Or drugs. One taste of him had me fiending and my heart beating out of my chest.\" \n OH YES!!! I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! 'Illegal Contact' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! \n Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. \n Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. \n \"I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed.\" \n Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. \n \"Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist.\" \n Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. \n \"The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion.\" \n \"I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion.\" \n I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. \n I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. \n When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! \n Gavin cocked a brow. \"If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 STARS!! \n \"Even though he lit up the room for everyone else, he only saw me. \n AAHHHH!!!! I cannot believe this is my first Santino Hassell book!! I LOVE his writing style!! Don't be put off by this being the fifth book in a series, it can stand alone in my opinion and also made me curious about the other books and characters in this amazing Five Boroughs world. \n This story felt very modern and relevant, mainly because the MC Ashton is an Instagram \"star.\" He is rich, gorgeous, and his life looks fabulous. From the outside. In reality, he is the classic \"poor little rich boy,\" looking for true love and instead hooking up endlessly with meaningless one-night stands. \n Val is a boxer from a poor family, the son of Ashton's nanny. He grew up with Ash and has had a crush on him since they were kids. Val sees the \"real\" Ash, the kind, generous and loving boy that he grew up with. \n \"The real Ashton--the quirky bastard with the smart-ass smile and thrift-store style--could get me to do anything. The Ashton he played for the rest of the world didn't have the same power.\" \n Ash is living a reckless life, filled with endless parties and endless men. Val will protect Ash at all costs, even at the expense of his intense training schedule. Val is a rising star in the boxing world and lives a clean lifestyle. \n Val always felt like an outsider in Ashton's world. Yet he was always there for him no matter what. Val never felt worthy of Ash and even though he has been secretly in love with Ash for years, Val doesn't believe that Ash could ever love someone like him. \n \"Even amid other rich folks and socialites, Ashton stole all the attention in the room. Elegant, and gorgeous, and so damn unique that people had paused in their own conversations to watch him approach. His presence was magnetic, and people were helplessly drawn to him. Myself included.\" \n Much of this book is spent with the two MC's in a dance around each other: both afraid to admit their true feelings BUT unable to deny the powerful attraction between them. The writing is beautiful and funny and painful all at once. Would these two gorgeous souls from very different worlds ever find their way back to each other? \n \"I could never stop thinking about Ashton, and I would never stop missing the quiet moments when it was just us and he was a devastatingly beautiful force of nature that had calmed just for me. \n Santino Hassell has now become a favorite author of mine. And I adore the SMOKING hot scenes between Ashton and Valdrin. OMG!! They burned up the pages. Bravo to you, Mr. Hassell! This book had everything I love about contemporary MM romance. Can't wait to read more from this author. \n \"He drew me into another kiss and, even with people flooding the space to surround us, I didn't see anyone but him.\"",

    "review_text": "3.5 Stars \n I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. . \n \"It's never been a game with you.\" \n Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. \n Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? \n \"He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about.\" \n There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. \n I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 I'm-Obsessed Stars!! \n Jessica Hawkins has written an engrossing and emotional romance that I simply couldn't put down! I am obsessed with Lake and Manning. Book #3 is releasing on 10/23 so if you've been waiting to start this series, don't delay! \n \"Ten months. That was how long I'd gone without a fix. Lake's letters came every couple weeks. I'd opened the first one, but that was it. I'd known right then that if I was going to make it through this, I couldn't think of her. Couldn't be inside her head that way, and she definitely couldn't be inside mine.\" \n My heart broke for Lake and Manning. They endured years apart and obstacles at every turn. I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can't wait to find out! \n \"But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake.\" \n This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!! Highly recommend this series for contemporary romance readers. I'm a Jessica Hawkins fan for life!! \n \" I couldn't tell her I loved her. I couldn't tell her I didn't. It killed me, but that was how it was. It wasn't going to be any other way, no matter how many times she put me in this goddamn position.\" \n Favorite quote: \n \"Maybe one day, Manning and I would challenge fate, defy gravity, and move the stars ourselves. But today was not that day.\"",

    "review_text": "3.5 Stars \n Sweet, sexy, small-town romance with not a lot of angst or tension. I am a huge fan of Harper Sloan's writing and her oh-so-sexy Alpha males so I had high hopes for this story. This is Maverick's book, he is a famous bull rider on the rodeo circuit but must cut his career short due to injuries. \n He returns home to the family and town he left behind and the sweet and beautiful Leigh, who has loved him since she was a young girl. She also happens to be Maverick's sister's best friend! \n There are plenty of sweet, sexy times in this book but the central conflict was worked out pretty early on. There are also lots of down-home, small-town feels to this book and all in all, it was an easy, steamy read. Of course the best scenes are between Maverick and Leigh. This book was perfectly enjoyable but it just didn't thrill me like Harper's earlier books. 'Lost Rider' is a great summertime read when you crave some sweet, country lovin'. \n \"I can't fix the past... I can't erase it, no matter how hard I wish I could. Hell, I can't even promise that I'll ever be able to forget it... The only thing I can do is to make sure that each day I live is worth somethin', from this day forward.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4 - 4.5 SEXXXXY STARS!! \n \"Sex is for the body. Romance is for the soul.\" \n OH YES!! Part 'Hitch' and part 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days', 'Mister Romance' is a delightfully sexy and warm-hearted romance that will thrill all contemporary romance lovers. \n I am a HUGE fan of Leisa Rayven. You can always count on this author to deliver a steamy, well-written story, and she lives up to her reputation with this yummy book. Surprisingly emotional yet funny and sharp, I enjoyed every minute of this fast-moving story. Eden Tate is stuck in a dead-end job that she hates. She is a smart and driven journalist but must land a big story in order to move up to a better position. She hears a rumor of a \"Mister Romance\", a mysterious man who acts as an escort to some of Manhattan's wealthiest and elite women. She is determined to uncover his true identity. \n Sounds cliche, no? But this story is much more than your standard rom-com. Eden has some heavy trust issues and \"M.R.\" actually beats her at her own game and turns the tables on her. And surprise! 'M.R.\" aka Max Riley is sexy and smart and just might be the one who shows Eden how to open her heart. \n This story had my heart pounding and had me cheering for Eden and Max. And the steamy scenes between Eden and Max are BURNING HOT!! I fell in love with all the characters in this book and their love story made me swoon. Highly recommend this book if you need some funny, romantic and light-hearted reading. And be prepared to be THRILLED by Max Riley!! \n \"Everything else in my life is optional, except you. You're essential.\" \n ARC provided in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars \n Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. \n Some books have \"it\" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. 'The Unrequited' has \"it.\" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. \n \"Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. \" \n Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla's story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! \n \"The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be.\" \n Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. \n But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla. You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together, but you just can't look away.",

Their smart and witty banter and the uber-steamy sex scenes elevate this contemporary romance above many in the genre and make this story a definite must-read. The Chicago setting is fabulous! \n Looking for a smart and sexy beach or poolside read?Then grab 'Black Tie Optional' and enjoy a few delicious hours of escape. \n \"What do you want, Olivia?\" he'd asked. \n \"Everything,\" she whispered. \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. \n But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. \n \"You were meant to do this,\" he said softly. \"You'll see.\" \n \"Why me?\" she asked. \"Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?\" \n \"Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James.\" \n And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. \n I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. \n \"Is this all a dream?\" That's the only thing that makes any sense. \n \"You aren't dreaming,\" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. \"But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?\" he asked. \n A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. \n \"Never.\" \n I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!! \n \"Do anything you must, but keep me forever.\" \n (With many thanks to the author for a review copy.)",

Ms. Salsbury has a gift for writing Alpha males and creating tortured, damaged souls. Aden and Sawyer are two lonely people who are \n brought together by a twist of fate...or is it by design? Sawyer makes a promise to her dying sister and travels to California to pack up her apartment. Aden suffers from extreme PTSD and can't let anyone get close to him. \n Sawyer and her sister are polar opposites - Sawyer is controlling, compulsive and rigid while her sister is carefree and lives life to the fullest.

Aden carries around the burden of tremendous guilt for things that happened during war. Can he love Sawyer without hurting her? \n I couldn't put this book down once I started!

I felt that I knew Ryan and Jackie, lived through their emotional highs and lows and and felt their pain. \n This story is emotional, romantic, sexy and epic.

Ryan did everything just to love her and and even stood by while both their lives went on, even though she was his one true love. \n Years pass and Ryan and Jackie are separated by circumstance and by life. Will Ryan and Jackie ever find their happily ever after? He is just the perfect man, completely devoted to Jackie yet willing to give her time and space. This is a very angsty book but at the same time, filled with hope and romance. \n The ending was a complete surprise which I did not see coming in a million years. Once again these two authors have delivered an emotional, sexy, real and gritty romance. Ryan and Jackie are two memorable characters, and their story is one I won't soon forget. \n \"Since the day you joined the world, you marched to the beat of your own drum.\"",

    "review_text": "\"We got here, baby, through fire and blades, demons and curses, blood and plagues.\" \n Just WOW. I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list! \n \"Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?\" \n This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire. \n Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts. \n \"Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it.\" \n 'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO. \n My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending. Loyalty, brotherhood, love, devotion, revenge and friendship...'Fury' has it all. Don't miss this one!! \n \"She is at the crux. She is the flame. My fever, my fury. Let it roar.\"",

    "review_text": "\"I'm curious whether you could ever like me, whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me.\" \n Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! \n Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. \n Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although \"out\" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. \n \"Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories.\" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. \n Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? \n \"But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?\" \n My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. \n I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. \n There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. \n Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. \n These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. \n Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a \"half-Jew in a Mormon town\" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.) \n Hopefully the LDS Church will have a \"revelation\" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church. \n \"To think that God loves the trees, but condemns that blossoming thing they do in the spring.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "I ALWAYS love a Kitty Thomas book! This one is dark yet very intriguing and sexy. It can be read as a standalone. \n This story started off very promising for me. I was fascinated by Julie, who worked as a waitress in a bar but dreamed of a normal life and family. Gabe was a regular customer who finally asked Julie out on a \"normal\" date. It was pretty clear from the beginning that Gabe was not interested in the white-picket-fence thing. \n I love a dark story but this one felt just a little rushed for me. The story took a very surprising turn at the beginning. Gabe comes to Julie's rescue but he is far from a knight in shining armor. He is very clear about his intentions right the start. Julie has feelings for Gabe and wants to please him but is not sure she can ever accept his lifestyle. \n I liked that Gabe never apologized for who he is. He wants to take care of Julie. I felt that Julie's wide-eyed innocence was little unrealistic but this story was engrossing enough that I wanted to see where her and Gabe's story ended up. \n I loved the scenes with Gabe and Julie together. This book was not as heavy on the erotic, steamy scenes as I would have expected, but I loved the plot and the pacing. Would Julie ever learn to trust Gabe and her true feelings? \n Kitty Thomas is an incredible writer and I absolutely love her books. 'Surrender' ended a little abruptly for me and while this story was not my favorite, I will continue to read anything this woman writes! \n \"But what I really want is someone who will call me 'master'. And I want that someone to be you.\"",

    "review_text": "What a ride!! Action-packed, SEXXXXY story. This book MUST be read after 'Jacked Up' so I'll keep this spoiler-free. Elle Aycart writes some of THE best contemporary romance stories and she delivers the goods plus some with this story. Nico's story is a wild ride and is a nice addition to anyone's romantic suspense library. \n \"...you are unraveling me piece by piece, and I fucking hate it.\" \n Ms. Aycart has created some very memorable characters in her books and this one is no exception. I loved the goth love interest here who really gives Nico a run for his money. Paige literally saves Nico's life and he will do anything for her. This story is a fast, action-packed read, and a great addition to the Bowen Boys series.",

    "review_text": "\"My life began and ended with them.\" \n Loved the series!! Must be read together and in order. Very adult, very sexy and very erotic. \n I don't shy away from love triangles so if you are a fan, by all means read this series. The first book is my favorite of the three and does an outstanding job of creating the beautiful and unbreakable bond between Danni and Cole and then...Trace! Yes, the author makes you believe that is possible to fall in love with two men. And now that the trilogy is complete, you can dive right into this angsty yet verrrry sexy series. \n I am going to keep this review short because I really don't want to give anything away about this book. I LOVED how Danni really held all the power in this book and was totally blindsided by the ending. BUT I loved how Pam Godwin wrapped this story up and I read this book in almost one sitting. The whole series is very fast-paced and fun and addictive and sexy. I loved both Cole and Trace, and could not imagine how this story would play out. \n \"This is your world.\" He spreads his arms wide. \"I just live in it. You own my heart, my every thought. You have the power to take whatever you want when you want it.\" \n Danni faces an almost-impossible decision in this book but there are no easy answers and the author certainly does not take the easy way out. I am usually not a huge fan of serials/series with cliffhangers but I loved this one and now that the story is complete, you can dive right in and read the whole trilogy. Was I emotional while reading this book? Yes. Was I rooting for both Cole AND Trace? YES!! But I love a good roller-coaster-ride of a story and Pam Godwin really delivered all the emotions. \n \"But the heart isn't logical. Sometimes, we don't know what we want until it's gone.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "I don't understand the enigma of love, only that it holds me hostage, cares for and worships me, abandons and breaks me, and always lures me back for more. \n Danni Angelo's life was completely disrupted and her world torn apart when she lost her first great love Cole. Time moved on and she found love again with Trace, a sexy, sophisticated and very different man than Cole. Trace was Danni's second chance at happiness. \n Danni never stopped loving Cole but now that she has fallen for Trace, Cole has reappeared in her life! So much must be explained and SO much is revealed in this second book in the series. How can Danni choose between two men who are her soulmates? And Cole and Trace deserve happiness, too! \n \"Cole. My first love. My greatest loss. \n Trace. He's supposed to be my new beginning. My future. \n Danni is not the \"bad guy\" for falling in love with two men. She never stopped loving Cole. But he was presumed gone. And now she needs some space to decide how to work this out or even if they can all her come to some kind of agreement. \n Both Cole and Trace are deeply in love with Danni and will do whatever it takes to come out on top. Sexual tensions run high. This isn't a typical love triangle in my opinion because Danni assumed Cole was long gone before she ever let herself have feelings for Trace. \n There are many more secrets and lots of intrigue in the story. Danni's life might be in danger due to the nature of Cole and Trace's work. Danni decides that she needs a break from Cole and Trace to decide what she wants to do with their relationship. \n I agree with some reviewers that this book was a total mind f**k!I felt just as torn between these two men as Danni did! They were both sexy and loving and protective. Yes this book does end on a cliffhanger but I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. Who will Danni give her heart to, body and soul? What will happen with Trace and Cole and the mystery package at the end of 'Two Is A Lie'? I can't wait to see!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"Because love doesn't end with death. It doesn't shrivel and disintegrate with the ashes. It hovers, follows, haunts the living.\" \n OH YES!!! My love Pam Godwin is back!! I devoured this morsel of a sweet and dirty story in a few hours and I CANNOT WAIT FOR MORE! Pam Godwin can pack more heart, soul and heat into a few paragraphs than most and I absolutely fell in love with Danni and Trace. Yes, this ends on quite the cliffhanger but it is not a total surprise. And getting there is all the fun. \n He's compelling, gorgeous, powerful. The kind of man a woman wants at her side, united and tangled, fighting for her, not against her. \n There are lots of romance tropes at play here but they all just WORK. I am a huge fan of Pam Godwin's writing and I adored this story. Since there is a huge cliffhanger, this review will be completely spoiler-free other than to mention that the story is HOT, fast-paced and has touches of humor!! Danni's wit and sarcasm was a welcome relief from the storyline. \n Read this book, the next book in the series releases in July and you will have your answers! (We'll, almost!) I don't know what will happen with Trace and Danni but I cannot wait to find out!! \n \"My life began the day we met. There is no before.

    "review_text": "First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books. And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. \n The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. \n Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. \n \"My arms outstretched, I'd danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang.\" \n And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. \n But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. \n \"One day you're going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I'll be here waiting for you,\" he whispers softly, his words a caress. \"Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn't please me to share you with others after all.\" \n There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn't work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books! \n Favorite quote: \n \"Il n'y a qu'un bonheur dans la vie, c'est d'aimer et d'etre aime.\" There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved. \n Our bodies are covered in sweat. The room smells like our dirty souls. And I fucking love it. \n There are others with far more classical features than hers. But none of them can hold a candle to her. She reminds me of the sea: untamed, unpredictable, but beautiful, so damn beautiful.",

    "review_text": "\"You're all mystery, Vera. Half-truths and bold statements, but you hide everything about you.\" \n This was my first book by Rachel Higginson and I throughly enjoyed it! It is a smart, witty, feel-good, sexy romance. Vera is a talented chef who spent time in Europe to escape from a toxic relationship. She used to dream of owning her own restaurant, but she now does the next best thing: she opens a food truck featuring her very inspired food creations. \n Vera parks her food truck in the parking lot of her brother's shop and it is directly across the street from a famous restaurant that employs the renowned Chef Killiam Quinn. Who is also famously difficult and temperamental. Killian actually sends one of his employees over to Vera's food truck to sample her creations and has the nerve to critique her techniques! \n And so begins a classic enemies-to-lovers story that was completely engrossing and very well-written. No insta-love here! Instead the author treats us to an intense slow-burn romance with fantastic dialogue and very well-developed characters. \n \"I looked into his eyes, but it turned out to be a mistake. He was too intense. Too overwhelming. He was everything hot and exciting, interesting and new.\" \n I love heroes main who are gruff, caustic and tough. Killian is a brilliant chef but he is closed off from forming an intimate relationship. While this might seem like a tired storyline, Rachel Higginson gives it a fresh spin and a very modern twist. The characters are all memorable and the dialogue is fresh and real. And I loved the whole idea of food truck vs. fancy restaurant - kind of a David and Goliath twist on this enemies-to-lovers story! Plus there is plenty of hot sexy times to satisfy every romance lover. This is a very original book, and I can't wait to read more from this incredible author! \n \"He was Killian Quinn, and he wasn't perfect. And I wanted to lick him from head to toe.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

I love Nicola Rendell's breezy, snappy writing style and her sex scenes are NOT to believed!! Grab me a fan!! \n Penny Darling is a small-town girl who has sworn off men (for now). She literally bumps into Russ at an airport and well let's just say things will never be the same! Russ is an ex-military man, all Alpha and appealing and sexy and irresistible. He is visiting Penny's sleepy little town for just a few days but finds Penny sweet, sexy and just his type. \n \"All I'm doing is negotiating. You've got something I want, and I plan to get it...Penny Darling.\" But I don't say it like a name. I say it like I mean it. Penny, darling. \n Half the fun of reading this book is Penny's HILARIOUS inner monologue. Good Lord, this Russ is a man who knows what he wants and isn't shy about going after it! Penny quickly falls under his spell but Russ is keeping a secret from Penny. \n Russ really is a good man, and he quickly falls for Penny. He lives in Boston but begins to fall in love with Penny's quirky small Florida town of Port Flamingo. I love the small-town romance trope but for me, some of the zany shenanigans here overshadowed the smoking hot relationship between Penny and Russ. I could not get enough of the scenes between these two!! \n \"I won't hurt you until you tell me I can.\" She gasps into her arm. \"Where did you learn to talk like that?\" \"Not learned. It's part of the package.\" \"I like the package,\" she says, as I position myself at her opening. \"You don't know the package.\" \n The steamy-hot romance, the humor, the dialogue...all of this added up to a winner for me. The author must have a terrific sense of humor because it really shines through in her writing. Penny is a very relatable heroine, warm, loyal, down-to-earth and FUNNY. She knows she is falling fast for Russ but these two are clearly meant for each other. Russ is simply irresistible and makes it easy for Penny to fall in love with him. \n \"Here lies Penelope Darling, who died of a swoon.\" \n Bravo to Ms. Rendell for writing a very adult, very explicit erotic romantic comedy. 'Just Like That' is a perfect book if you are looking for a swoony, SEXY and very, very hot read with two very relatable main characters. Loved the Epilogue and I'm really looking forward to more books from this incredibly talented author. \n \"All day, it's been you. Since the minute I saw you, it's been you. My whole life, even before I knew you, it was you.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 - 5 GORGEOUS STARS \n \"No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine.\" \n Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! \n Called a contemporary romance \"with paranormal elements,\" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! \n Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. \n \"But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more.\" \n What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! \n \"Nikolai Alexei,\" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. \"Who are you?\" \n There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! \n \"Love and hope,\" she said. \"That's life to me.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 - 5 Stars!!! \n \"You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are.\" \n Run, don't walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata's writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can't get enough!! \n I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She's driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team's assistant coaches. \n I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I'd grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. \n Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. \n To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she'd been around once. \n Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn't trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. \n This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata's writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn't even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! \n \"I used to have a huge crush on you.\" \n The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn't like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there'd been posters of him all over my wall. Or that 'Sal loves Kulti' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. \n \"Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then.\" \n Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it's cracked up to be and that Kulti really can't lead a 'normal' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. \n I'm not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn't like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. \n This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read! \n \"This,\" he pointed between us. \"This is what matters. You are my gift, my second chance, and I will cherish you and your dream. I will protect both of you.",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars \n LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, 'American Prince' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry's story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. \n \"I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble.\" \n Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! \n \"And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband's heart in his hands and he doesn't even know it. He's too busy looking at the details of Ash's faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is.\" \n One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone's great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there's plenty of time to read this series before 'American King' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!! \n \"I'm done running from you,\" I said honestly. \"I tried and it didn't matter--you haunted me everywhere I went.\" \n \"And you haunted me,\" he murmured, rolling over to press his lips against mine once more. \"My little prince.\" \n And so the next act in our tragedy began.",

    "review_text": "OMG!! This book was both hilarious AND hot!! I have read many office romances but 'Tempt the Boss' is one of my favorites. Modern, sexy, and very funny, Natasha Madison is an author to watch! I loved Lauren and Austin's sexy, witty, sarcastic banter. This book was pure FUN and a fantastic escapist read. \n Lauren has to re-enter the workforce after the sudden break-up of her marriage. Enter her beast of a boss, who can't seem to keep an assistant for more than a few days at a time. Difficult, demanding and sarcastic, Austin is just plain horrible!! \n \"When I ask you to get me coffee, I'm not asking you to join me for a cup. When I tell you to scan and email something, I don't need reporting of the task as if you're waiting for a sticker on your paper. When you have a caller on hold, I don't need you announcing them to me through the intercom in a singsong voice. I also don't need you knocking on my door every few minutes to ask me if I need anything. Trust me, when I need something, you'll be the first one to know.\" \n Lauren holds her own, though, and refuses to quit. She's smart, tough and gets even with Austin for his outrageous behavior. Let the games commence! Once these two start playing pranks on each other, hilarity ensues. This story is funny, fast-paced, H-A-W-T but has lots of heart and sweetness underneath all the wit. Once these two get together, watch out!! \n \"I can only be a gentleman for so long, baby,\" I whisper roughly in her ear and then roll the lobe between my lips. Her head falls back, hitting the wall. \n BUT...Austin lives by his own set of rules and one of them is that he never, ever dates anyone from his office. Even though he and Lauren have an undeniable connection, he wants to her to quit so that they can continue to see each other. Lauren refuses to give in, even when Austin makes it almost impossible for to stay! \n \"He wants me to quit. Well, fuck that! I'm going to make him regret he made this stupid rule, even if I give myself blue balls, or a blue vagina, or whatever.\" \n This the first book I have read by Natasha Madison and I loved it! She has a gift for writing sexy banter and I absolutely loved the way Lauren held her own as a single mom. Her children are an integral part of this story and the ending was perfect for these two characters. This story had heat, heart and tons of sexy times. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Austin's point of view was PERFECT. If you're a fan of Emma Chase, you will LOVE Natasha Madison! \n \"Not just her body, though her body is meant to be worshipped, but her head, her heart. I want it all.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 Memorable Stars!!! \n I am not sure how to categorize this beautiful and unforgettable story but Mara White really shows her writing skills with 'Touched'. This is not so much a romance as a coming of age story, BUT there is romance and love in this beautiful story. The cover is a perfect rendition of the story inside: ethereal, tempestuous and achingly beautiful. \n \"Her sister was made exactly how she was supposed to be. Untouchable.\" \n This is the story of two sisters who grew up in abject poverty. But the author doesn't write them as pitiful characters; instead they are resourceful, industrious and most of all, survivors. They suffer through an absolutely brutal childhood which leaves June damaged and unable to be touched by anyone. But there is most definitely lots of love and devotion in this story. The sisters cross paths with Alaric and there are many tender moments between the sisters and their new young friend. \n \"June was a free bird; no cages could withstand her. Escape or die trying.\" \n I read this story in mid-Summer, before the advent of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. So the story is especially relevant now, as it deals with the terrible impact of Hurricane Katrina on the citizens of Louisiana. \n I realize this review is vague but this is an epic story that spans years and locations and jumps back and forth in time. I can't really write any more detail without spoiling the plot. And the ending!! This is Mara White's BEST book yet and should not be missed. If you are up for an epic story with love and suffering and beauty and multi-dimensional characters, then read 'Touched'. You won't soon forget it! \n \"The good Lord made us the way he intended us to be. There are no mistakes in His divine hands.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.(",

    "review_text": "\"How did it come to this? How did we get here? How will it end?\" \n What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. \n \"Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different.\" \n The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. \n The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. \n \"The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it.\" \n We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to \"chase\" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. \n They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear \"off the grid\" so that she would never find them again. \n This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? \n \"Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?\" \n This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away \"eclipse chasing\" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!",

    "review_text": "Smart and sexy and delicious! I devoured this one. LOVE Ryder!!!! \n This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although 'Sweet Rivalry' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in 'Sweet Cheeks' as Saylor's brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. \n Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? \n \"Beard burn is a real thing. \n And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. \" \n I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg's books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then 'Sweet Rivalry' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn't longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

You own me like no one ever has, or ever will.\" \n Looking for an escapist read that will enthrall you for a few hours? Then 'Nova' is for you. A fast-paced, YA story set in exotic locales all over the world, Landon and Rachel's story is fun, a little emotional, sexy and very enjoyable. Rebecca Yarros is a terrific writer and has created characters that seem very relatable and very real. \n Landon and Rachel had a very intense love but he left her behind to go off in search of adventure with the Renegades.

Both Landon and Rachel are now on the same Study at Sea program, he is shocked but wants to do everything in his power to try and win her back. \n They have fantastic chemistry but Rachel is broken-hearted.

The deep friendships between all the characters form a big part of this book and I loved how supportive each friend was. This is a lovely second-chance romance with tons of action and sweet emotion thrown in the mix. And the cover! I love a sexy, eye-catching cover.

    "review_text": "Loved!! Sexy and refreshingly funny. I heard so much about this book and picked it up when I was craving something different and light. Sort of a book within a book, 44 Chapters is in the form of a journal written by a wife and mother who is experiencing something of a lull in her marriage. She was a tattooed wild child who ended up married to an accountant! How did that happen?! \n \"It's a beautiful life Ken has given me, one filled with security and laughter and intelligent conversation and honeymoons in Paris and well-behaved children with long attention spans and cute noses and his-and-hers sinks and 401(k)s and well-manicured lawns. I just wish the orgasms matched the drapes, if you know what I mean.\" \n BB adores her husband Ken but things have gotten a little .... quiet. BB discovers that Ken may have secretly read parts of her journal, and when he does, things get MUCH spicier and hotter between them. Thrilled with Ken's newfound interest in sex, BB decides to embellish the stories of her past boyfriends. The writing is absolutely charming and hilarious, written as if BB was talking to a best friend. I was really hoping for Ken to wake up and take an interest in his marriage because it was obvious they had amazing chemistry together. \n What he does have is a Captain America-style square jaw with a subtle cleft and a permanent five o'clock shadow. He also has enviously high cheekbones. His aqua-blue eyes are hooded by long espresso-colored lashes, and his sandy-brown hair is just long enough on top to allow for a good grip. His physique is lean yet muscular. His sense of humor is dry. He is brilliant and self-deprecating, and he has the ability to skip rocks across any body of water (a secret turn-on of mine). \n This book is best enjoyed with glass or two of wine. I can't believe this is BB Easton's debut book! Each of her past boyfriends was charming, dangerous, sweet and sexy in their own way. I loved the descriptions of teenage first love and the '80s references were priceless. BB Easton is nothing if not brutally honest. Her descriptions of married life and babies are spot-on. Everyone can relate to this story! BB spends much of the book hoping that her straight-laced husband will get her name visibly tattooed somewhere on his body. And she just wants him to be a little more aggressive. She doesn't think she is asking for too much! \n I want to take him with me everywhere. I want us to live a hundred years and die at the same time. I want them to mix our cremated remains together, dump us into a river, and watch our mingled ashes swirl like coffee creamer all the way to the ocean. I want our souls (okay, my soul and his, whatever he has, operating system?) to find each other on the other side as soon as possible just so that we can fall in love and make more babies and do it all over again. I just also want him to f*ck my brains out. \n This is a very funny book, written with great sensitivity and a sharp eye for detail. BB Easton has already written the next book in this series which is about her boyfriend Knight. What a character!! I can't wait to read his story, 'Skin.' I was pleasantly surprised by this wild and crazy story! After reading this, I feel like BB Easton is an old friend. I love her writing style! Pick up this book if you're in the mood for a funny, very raunchy story.",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars!!! \n Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! \n \"You can't fix me you know...\" \n Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she's done it again with 'Most of All You.' Gabriel and Crystal's story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. \n \"He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... \n This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal's new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. \n \"I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life.\" \n While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. \n \"Choice is such a loaded word, isn't it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past.\" \n This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal's story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I'm glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. \n \"I wasn't a victim. I was a survivor...\" \n Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don't want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton! \n \"The longer she'd touched me, the more a yearning rose in my soul, so strong it took my breath.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. \n The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. \n \"There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star.\" \n Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the \"Kelley Trio\" - yes, Officer Kelley! \n Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! \n \"Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot.\" Oh my God. I didn't just say that. \n But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. \"A cop! I meant a cop.\" \n This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor. If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours, then this is the book for you!",

    "review_text": "3.5 - 4 Stars \n This is definitely a case of it's not you, it's me. So many readers adore this story!! And I am a HUGE fan of Pepper Winters. First of all, this cover is absolutely stunning. I would read this book based on the cover alone. And I love the chemistry between the two MC's in this story. And as usual, Pepper creates a strong-willed, kick-ass heroine who is smart, driven and beautiful. \n The story is promising: Elle is assaulted as a young teenager by a gang of thugs in New York and is rescued by a mysterious stranger. Sadly, she never sees his face and can't help him as he is carted off by the police that night. But she never forgets the man who saved her life and with whom she spent a few very memorable hours. \n Fast forward years later and Elle is the head of a large retail company. She is single but her father tries to fix her up with nearly every eligible bachelor he meets. But when Elle and Penn meet, she is taken by his dark good looks and dominating personality. \n Fierce eyebrows gave expression and authority to the intensity of his dark brown eyes. Dark hair bordering on black curled around his cheeks, forehead, and ears, speaking of wildness rather than tamed. His strong nose and refined cheekbones were perfect adornments to the beard bordering his lips. \n Penn is dangerous, for sure, but nevertheless alluring to the sheltered Elle. She hasn't had much real-world experience and she finds Penn incredibly sexy. \n I narrowed my eyes. \"What do you want from me?\" \n He smiled, his mouth once again bewitching me. \"Not sure yet.\" \n Who is Penn? Can he be trusted? He quite literally sweeps Elle off her feet. Set against the backdrop of New York City, this darkly sexy story is classic Pepper Winters. Everyone has secrets and nothing is at it seems. \n Pulling away, he rested his forehead on mine, a roguish smile replacing his grimace. \"I'm not letting you go. I've only just found you.\" \n Some of the plot points of the story fell a little flat for me and took me out of the story. Other readers seem to overlook these issues so if you are a fan of dark romance, then give this one a go! Although this story ends with a cliffhanger, the next book should be coming out soon and I am curious to see where these characters end up.",

    "review_text": "\"No matter what happens, even on your worst day, find something to be grateful about. It'll make you feel better.\" \n What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful, it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real, very human, funny, flawed and just very authentic. \n Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City, having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay, She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it \"more heart.\" She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. \n \"One person alone against winter was rough. But two people, together... Together. A word I never used.\" \n Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment, temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly, they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. \n \"...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had.\" \n A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the \"extras\" in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story. \n \"You are my home, baby,\" he said. \"I never want to be anywhere else.\" \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "4 1/2 Stars!! \n What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. \n \"Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me.\" \n My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. \n The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. \n \"Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed.\" \n Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. \n \"Thank you, Preston.\" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. \n Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around. \n \"Or actually, maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start. Tonight. This is our beginning, Annalia.\"",

I'll spend every cent I have, break every goddamn law to keep you.\" \n The second book of the Endgame series begins right were 'The Pawn' ended. Avery has really hit rock bottom. She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and 'The Knight' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. \n Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren's writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here, he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father's downfall. Make no mistake, Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure, and he still remains mysterious. \n I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery's mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. 'The Knight' ends on a surprising note and I can't wait to read 'The Castle,' the third book in this series. \n Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark, very sensual and dangerous. Highly recommend these books for all lovers of dark and sexy romance.",

    "review_text": "\"Some of the best times in life come from bad ideas.\" \n Sometimes you need a good old-fashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book! Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny, sexy, tender-hearted romance that is creative, engaging and sweet. \n I enjoyed every minute of this book. Emerie and Drew \"meet cute\" and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland's romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew, an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe, for very good reason. I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!! This book is literally laugh-out-loud funny. \n \"And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them.\" \n \"Damn straight. I'm like a superhero. The Prolactinator.\" \n Egomaniac is a super-sexy, very fast-paced read that has lots of warmth and heart. It is witty and smart and very addicting. I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author. \n \"Maybe, just maybe, neither one of us had found the right one before now...because we hadn't met each other yet.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\" \n A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. \n The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. \n Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. \n Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. \n \"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\" \n The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. \n The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then \"The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers. \n (Copy provided by the publisher via NetGalley.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 Amazing Stars!! \n When a trusted author friend recommended this book to me, I immediately downloaded it and dove right in. Wait, I thought, this book is how long??! 'Juniper Smoke' is an odyssey, a fantastic, sexy, funny, smart and heart-stopping journey that I never wanted to end. \n \"I, Juniper Mills, always run away from the people I love. It is the story and sequel of my life.\" \n There is just so much to love about this book that I want to yell from the rooftops for everyone to read it! Juniper might be one of the sassiest, wittiest and smartest heroines I have read in a long time. She is simply a breath of fresh air. And Kyle Paxton, OMG KYLE!! Where do I even begin. In a sea of billionaire bachelors and dark heroes, he is a standout. I will never forget him. Poor, wealthy, lonely Kyle. Forget everything you know about reading contemporary romance novels because Sadia Ash just threw it all out the window. Her characters are fresh, damaged, strong, lonely and smart. \n \"Will you please leave? And stop looking up.\" \n \"Give me a reason to stop looking up.\" \n Great. A Comedy Central reject. \"Are you one of the waiters?\" \n \"Hmm. Telekinesis. I think I've found my soul mate.\" \n There is so much to say about this book. The basics are that Juniper (yes, named after the tree) is a junior curator at a museum in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Kyle Paxton is a wealthy investor who founded a tech start-up company at a very young age. He is sexy and gorgeous and geeky and does not have normal relationships with women. But Juniper is basically a goner from the minute they meet. \n \"He laughed and it was a pleasant deep-throated sound. He held me so close, it vibrated in my body. Wow. If I could record and harness Kyle's remarkable laugh all the world's babies would stop crying and maybe the adults would be moved to work for peace. I felt happiness I had never known before. Then I got sad, for very soon I would never see this hot and mysterious stranger again.\" \n Lonely Juniper has been raised by a single mother who has had a hard life and so taught Juniper that men and relationships were to be avoided. So she finds herself unable to connect with men at the ripe old age of 26. Friends, yes, a great job, yes, but this geeky girl runs in the other direction where men are concerned. \n See, I was raised to hate men. My mother didn't raise me to believe in fairytales. Only unfairy tales. \n Kyle is as smitten with Juniper as she is with him. But this delicious, slow-burn romance takes its time with the characters and the story and by the time these two get together, I was addicted to their story. \n Okay, there it was. I was outed in my mind. I want Kyle Paxton. And getting him was as easy as collecting the Pacific Ocean in a teacup. I was screwed. \n Sadia Ash's writing is sharp, biting, funny and verrrrry sexy. In fact, the only complaint I have about 'Juniper Smoke' is that it ended! I even liked Kyle, although at many times he came across as cold and calculating. It was part of his charm but he did frustrate me at times. \n His expression grew distant again. \"No. I've already said too much. Don't read too much into it, Juniper. I make my decisions on human capital quickly. When I meet people, I know at once if I want to work with them and if I want to be with them.\" \n There is a LOT to absorb in this book but I absolutely loved the how the settings changed, from frosty Michigan to California and back again. Every chapter was richly drawn and seemed vital to the story. The connection between Juniper and Kyle was as breathtaking as it was tinged with sadness. I really felt the emotional connection between the characters here and the author made them come alive for me. \n A lump formed in my throat, for despite the blank way he spoke, I felt the ache in his voice, the loneliness in his words, and the vulnerability in his eyes. I had never seen him falter from his alpha-male facade at any time, and so this fragmented man in front of me was fascinating. Intriguing. Complex. Just my type. Danger bells again. \n The story was creative and unexpected and surprised me at every turn. It is filled with people, places and things that all have meaning. I was completely taken aback at the ending and cannot wait until the next part of Juniper and Kyle's story comes out! I will read anything that Sadia Ash writes. If you are looking for a book that is far and away different from any other romance out there, then read 'Juniper Smoke' and prepare to fall in love with these characters! \n \"Real life has tears and stupid emotions and mess and dirt and filth and drama that go with every beautiful thing we do. There is beauty in everything that falls. Like this.\"",

    "review_text": "3.5 Stars \n 'Bombshell' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. \n I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. \n The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes! \n (ARC provided by Montlake in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars \n \"If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?\" \n OMG!! Intelligent and thrilling page-turner that I read in almost one sitting! The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. \n I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. \n The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. What is happening to Cass? \n Cass's mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. \n I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "What an outstanding debut!! Sexy and intense and messy. If you're expecting a hearts and flowers romance, then find another book! James and Madison's painful story completely captivated me. \n A War Like Ours is a compelling, gritty and enthralling book. Once I started I could not put it down! I love stories where the main protagonists are imperfect characters. James and Madison make poor choices in their lives, but somehow the author makes it all seem very believable and just plain real. Also: there is no insta-love here so if you like a story that takes some time to build, then you will love A War Like Ours. \n \"Let the pain take over. Let it own you, turn you inside out. Let it win, Madison.\" \n James Maxwell is harboring a big secret. A life-altering, painful secret. He is a brilliant cancer researcher but is not handling his personal life very well at all. He has a beautiful young daughter but he is keeping something from her that is getting more difficult to withhold with the each passing day. As much as I did not agree with James, I totally understood his pain and grief thanks to Saffron Kent's incredible writing. Lonely and tortured, he seeks out Madison, a staff member at the summer resort where he is staying. Somehow he sees a kindred spirit in her. \n Madison is bitter and depressed. She is stuck in a relationship for all the wrong reasons. For some reason she is drawn to James. But their relationship is fiery, explosive and not at all peaceful. Madion has a deep-seated hatred for men but yet she feels something - sympathy? lust? - for the very sexy and emotionally unavailable James. \n This story is raw and explicit and very emotional. I could not wait to see if James and Madison got the happy ending they so desperately deserved. All the characters in this book are very flawed and very unusual. I was blown away by this debut book by Saffron Kent and can't wait to read more from this very talented writer. \n \"A beating heart doesn't mean that I'm alive.\" \n \"No, it only means you want to be. It's the nature of all living things. They want to live, break free. They want a miracle. It's called hope. Hope that one day something will transform our life, transform us as we know it.\" \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "\"Mack was the only one for me. There was no way this feeling could ever be replicated...because it had been years in the making.\" \n Penelope Ward is an auto-buy author for me. Hands down, her second-chance romances are among my absolute favorite stories! Her main characters always have tons of heart, soul and chemistry, And humor! And I adore the catchy title of this book. \n Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankie's class in Boston. Mack has broken up with his son's mother, with whom he had a long-term relationship. Mack and Frankie were roommates years before, with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack. But they were not meant to be, and went their separate ways. \n Now Mack has shown up, determined to win Frankie back. She is the love of his life. The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend, an older, very stable college professor who adores her. What will Frankie do? Told in alternating POV's, we read how Mack and Frankie's love blossomed several years before. They are simply meant to be. \n \"Remember all those things you wished I could do to you? I'm about to make all your wishes come true if you let me.\" \n All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF. Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book! But at its heart it is a gorgeous second-chance romance as only Ms. Ward can write. \n Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot. I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Mack's son Jonah. I also adored Frankie's boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack, the love of her life, and her current boyfriend. Ms. Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity. This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once. Overall a lovely, emotional and sexxxxxy story with lots of heat and heart!! \n \"I lost all those years, only to end up in the same place, wanting you and wishing I hadn't ever let you go.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "Dawn makes a sound. If you listen closely, right as the sun starts to come up, you'll hear it. It's like the echo of birth: silence, followed by a gentle push, followed by moans, then the sloppy deluge of new life. On good days I like it because it reminds me that I'm alive. On bad days it makes me feel like dust. \n Can you believe that writing? I read this book as part of my New Year's resolution to go through my Kindle and read some of the many, many books already there. And I picked a winner. Sadly, it doesn't seem like this is available in ebook format right now but I hope that changes soon. \n Yes, I know, I am very late to the party on this one. But GSH has now made it onto my list of favorite books ever. I had heard so much about this book and it lived up to every word of hype. I fell in love with Jacob Grace and want to be best friends with Beatrice! \n \"Something about being with him made me warm, like I was sitting in front of a fireplace whose embers were barely flickering, yet still giving off heat. It made me feel safe.\" \n Beatrice is a lonely artist living in the vast wasteland called Los Angeles and meets a kindred soul in Jacob, a writer. They are both funny, sad, loyal and both seeking the perfect soul mate. This book is at times hilarious, poignant, tragic and uplifting. The description of life in L.A. is priceless. \n She tossed her hair around when she laughed like the glamorous android slut monster I knew she was. Jacob would never give the time of day to a girl like her, I told myself. Be that as it may, I focused on the ceiling panel above her head. I tried to will it loose. I wanted it to crash down and squash her like a villain in a cartoon. And I'm a pacifist. \n This book is a journey and although I could tell where the story was ultimately going, it was absolutely breathtaking. The author has a true gift of words. Her characters were vivid, real, funny and very flawed. I can't wait to read 'How to Kill a Rock Star' and experience more of her talent for storytelling. \n \"That's why I love you. Because you say ridiculous fucking things like that. Normal people don't say things like that, Jacob. All my life I waited for someone who would say things like that to me. And for someone I didn't feel alone in the presence of. Someone who understood. Someone who would make me feel like it wasn't just me against the world. Even when we're not together.\" \n The author has lots to say about love, sex, friendship, forgiveness and the bonds of family. This book resonated with me on many different levels. Read this book!! It might change your life!! And the cover is absolutely perfect for the story. I highlighted a ton of passages in this book and it is very difficult to pick a favorite but I loved this one: \n \"We're all searching for something to fill up what I like to call that big, God-shaped hole in our souls. Some people use alcohol, or sex, or their children, or food, or money, or music, or heroin. A lot of people even use the concept of God itself. I could go on and on. I used to know a girl who used shoes. She had over two-hundred pairs. But it's all the same thing, really. People, for some stupid reason, think they can escape their sorrows.\" \n Tiffanie DeBartolo is my kind of writer and I can't wait to read more of her stories.",

    "review_text": "CD Reiss is one of my favorite romance authors. Her writing is mature, sexy, nuanced and never fails to grab me. And I do love books about marriage. Separation Games was a perfect conclusion to the first book in this series. Marriage Games ended with an unusual twist and I absolutely loved how the author worked things out between Adam and Diana. I feel both of their pain, confusion and longing. \n And Adam, OMG! He was one of the author's most memorable heroes. Wow. Both Diana and Adam are mature, smart and very driven. This book is off-the-charts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist. \n \"Beg to come.\" \n \"Please.\" \n \"Beg harder.\" \n Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues, it is explosive. I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didn't love, and this duet is no exception. The supporting characters are all very well-written and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story. The Epilogue is fantastic! I was actually sorry to see this story end. Highly recommend this steamy, emotional and very mature erotic romance. \n \"Your problem isn't that you don't love. Your problem is you love so much it scares you.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

If you need a Kristen Ashley fix, do NOT miss Marcus and Daisy's novella!! Pure goodness and beauty. \n If you're a fan of the Rock Chick series (and let's face it, who isn't??), Daisy has been a constant. Such a character! But without a doubt a sweetheart. Her story has been a long time coming and it hit all the hight notes. Only Kristen Ashley can make a novella feel as satisfying as a full-length novel. Marcus and Daisy are pure KA gold. All of the wonderful writing, emotion, plot and LOVE that you expect from Kristen Ashley are here. And kudos to the author for tackling a very sensitive subject and handling it perfectly. If you need a hit of Kristen Ashley, 'Rock Chick Reawakening' is your answer. It's everything you expect from the Queen of Alphas and much more. \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult, very erotic, very explicit romance that I really fell for. \n The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. \n Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. \n This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book. \n Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure. \n \"I don't want you to touch me like Weston,\" I said, once and for all. \"I don't want Weston! I want you!\" \n Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. \"I know. I was waiting for you to know too.\" \n Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. \n Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win. \n I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!! \n \"Were you even going to say goodbye?\" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all. \n He smiled lazily. \"I don't know what you mean. I'm still here.\" \n \"You're just as much already gone.\" \n His face was in the shadows, but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn't see it. \"I'm less gone than you'd imagine.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

Can't wait to read 'American Prince. ' \n Those were my very first thoughts after finishing this book. It was sitting on my Kindle for a long time and I'll admit I kept looking at it, thinking, \"What is this? Queen? Another royalty book? What?\" BUT once I started I couldn't stop! Ash, Embry and Greer's story is sizzling, stormy, loving, everlasting and completely gripping. \n \"All the words that men use about women--enchanted, charmed, addicted--they don't even begin to cover what I felt for you and your handful of shattered glass. I thought about you that night, and the next and the next, and when I was deployed to Carpathia, you were all I thought about. I built these fantasies in my mind where I would come home after the war and find you at whatever university you were at. I would kiss you until you were like you were that night at the party, begging me to do whatever I wanted.\" \n Oh Ash, you sweet-talker you! This is a story of three intertwined lives and their rise to the top of American politics. Since 'Priest' by Sierra Simone is one of my favorite erotica books, I knew that I would love this one. I just wasn't prepared for the level of hotness and (slight) depravity! And I mean that in the nicest way. \n I rarely have time to read a series back to back but I did just that with 'American Queen' and 'American Prince.' The books are just that good!! There are villains and back-stabbers and war and bravery and lots and lots of sex. And I mean TONS. And a good, not-so-old-fashioned love story. \n \"I fell in love with Ash, only to watch him marry another woman. I slept with a different man, only to never hear from him again.\" \n Ash and Embry are war heroes who are now the President and Vice-President of United States, respectively. Their love for each other and for Greer unfolds through alternating points of view and flashbacks between the past and the present. This is a very clever tale filled with references to the story of King Arthur and Camelot but also THE hottest and most passionate love scenes I've ever read. Ash, Embry and Greer are all perfect for each other but will they find some kind of happily ever after? I loved the conclusion to this book and I can say that the next one was just as enticing. If you are looking for something spicy and intelligent and gripping, then you will absolutely adore 'American Queen'! \n \"Let me bleed for you again.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 - 5 Stars!! \n \"It's always the ones who are the quietest who often have the greatest things to say. And yes, I think we'll be friends.\" \n Simple, beautiful and unforgettable, 'Wolfsong' was one of the most gripping books I've read all year. Never in a million years did I think I would love a book about werewolves with a little fantasy sprinkled in but this book and this writing is just gorgeous. If you want to take a chance an read something that is a little outside your comfort zone, read this book!! I will never forget the great Ox and the entire Bennett family. \n A story about love, devotion, loyalty, friendship and family, 'Wolfsong' was also one of the most stunning love stories I've ever read. Ox, a kind, lovely soul, lives in a small town and lives a very quiet life with his mother. Until he meets Joe, and then his whole world is turned upside down. \n \"Words. Words were my enemy. How to say that here was where I felt the safest. Here was where I felt most at home. Here was where I wouldn't be judged. I wasn't a fucking retard here. I wasn't a waste of space or time. I wanted to say so much, too much, and found I couldn't really say anything at all.\" \n I highlighted so much of this epic story that my entire review could be made of quotes from this extraordinary book! Every character, every scene felt necessary and breathtaking. The bonds between Ox, Joe and the Bennett family seemed unbreakable and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this amazing author would take, me. This book is quite a journey and I loved every single minute. \n \"It was not a gradual thing. Wait. That was a lie. I didn't know it was a gradual thing. But it must have been. It had to have been. Because it's the only thing that explained the cosmic explosion that was the feeling of want and need and mine mine mine. The force of it was ridiculous. It had to have been there. For a long time.\" \n Fantasy books are usually not my thing but this book completely grabbed me from the first page. I felt as if I knew each of these characters. I wanted to wrap my arms around Ox and give him a big hug. These characters literally came to life before my eyes! I became entranced by the Oregon setting and the Bennett clan. I only wanted Ox and Joe to have their happy ending because they both deserved it so, so much. \n \"I would do anything to make you happy because no one had ever smelled like you did. It was candy canes and pinecones. It was epic and awesome. And it was home. You smelled like my home, Ox.\" \n I don't want to go into detail about the plot because it was surprising and thrilling. Take a chance on 'Wolfsong' and read this book! It was simply glorious. Definitely one of those books that would make a fantastic movie. \n \"It's easy to get lost, Ox, because the world is a wide and scary place. And every now and then, you just have to be reminded of the way home.\"",

    "review_text": "4.5 - 5 Stars!! \n \"Just like I tell the boys, we don't play for one single run, we play to win the whole game. And I'm in it to win it.\" \n Mariana Zapata, where have you been all my life!? 'Wait for It' was completely engrossing; a slow-burn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again. And now I must decide which one of her books to read next! This was my first book by this amazing author, and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story! \n 'Wait for It' is not a predictable story. It is a solid, real, passionate romance, filled with heart and humor and heart-stopping love. Diana is single and raising two young boys. She is independent, funny, hard-working and definitely NOT looking for romance. \n She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way, and they actually get off to a very rocky start. Dallas is stern, uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL. \n What were you supposed to do when someone didn't want to be your friend or at least be friendly, and you'd tried your best? I thought I'd been a pretty good person. A pretty good neighbor. I hadn't done anything to make him feel uncomfortable. At least, I genuinely didn't think I had. \n Diana oh-so-slowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boy's baseball team. Between baseball and being neighbors, Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story. \n He has a soft spot for single moms. You are no one special, Diana, I reminded myself. You are no one special. \n Mariana Zapata's writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next. I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana! The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real. The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly. No insta-love here, folks. This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful. \n 'Wait for It\" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn't that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book. It is gorgeous. \n \"She wouldn't be my first, but she'd be the only one who ever mattered. I think she could wait for the time to be right. I'd make sure she never regretted it.\"",

    "review_text": "\"I swear. Give me one more chance and I will make the most of it.\" \n Reading this book made me a better person. I can't find the right words to describe this magnificent story! I'm not eloquent enough. I want to be Suanne Laquer's best friend. Read this book. It will change your life. Very few authors have a way with words like Suanne Laquer. She reaches in and grabs your heart and doesn't let go. \n \"I think love is a big wisdom made up of small understandings.\" \n This book tells the interwoven tale of several main characters. Geno and Carlos were twins and enjoyed an unbreakable bond as many twins do. Fairly early on in the story, Geno is subject to the most awful kind of abuse which would have broken most people. And for a while, it seems as though Geno will never recover from his terrible ordeal. Geno copes with the agony of his assault by turning to an alter-ego that was based on his twin brother Carlos. \n \"Carlos was Los. Geronimo was Mos. Los and Mos lived in the starry world of Nos, Spanish for we. Nos rhymed with dos, Spanish for two.\" \n Geno was a gorgeous soul who was turned into an empty shell by acts of pure evil. I could not imagine how he would ever climb out of the black hole of despair that he was in. But this is ultimately a tale of hope and beauty, even though the author does not shy away from a difficult, agonizing and painful subject. My heart broke for Geno and his family. \n Steffen Finch is an art therapist who seems to be the only person who can get through to Geno. At the same time, Stef and Javier Landes begin a relationship together that can only be described as pure bliss. And just in case you think this book is only filled with treacherous story lines and complete tragedy, it is not! Suanne Laquer is very funny and she works in many lighthearted moments. This book is very much like real life, mixing in the gritty moments with the funny ones. \n \"Hi,\" Jav said. \n \"Hi. If I kiss you outside my mother's bedroom, I'm going to need therapy.\" \n \"How about the closet?\" \n And so, Stef, Javier and Geno's stories slowly become intertwined as Stef begins to treat Geno with art therapy. We get to experience the healing process as well as the gorgeous blossoming relationship between Stef and Javier. Everything in this book unfolds with perfect timing, and nothing is ever rushed or forced. Even after finishing this book months ago, I still feel as though all of the characters were real. And that is quite a feat for an author to accomplish. At the risk of rambling on and on, I will also say that I highlighted huge portions of this book. And that I LOVED all of the supporting characters. \n The chemistry between Stef and Jav was absolutely off the charts. They both had insecurities going into their relationship which made them both all the more believable. This felt like a genuine partnership. No insta-love, but instead a rich and nuanced passion for each other. \n \"Tonight their bedroom overflowed with magnificent sex. Death by sex. Grandiose, over-the-top sex. They were making love like architects of the universe. Fucking like mathematicians. Multiplying, dividing, canceling each other out and starting from zero. \n I am simply in awe of Suanne Laquer. This book is breathtaking! Although it can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend you first read 'An Exaltation of Larks' - which is only 99 cents at the time of this review. If you only read a few books a year, make 'A Charm of Finches' one of them. Filled with rich imagery, passion and pure emotion, it is unforgettable. \n \"I want this feeling I have with him. When I'm around him I feel honest. I feel authentic. I feel myself and I see so clearly who I want to be and the life I want to lead. And the kind of person I want to have with me on the ride. A curator and sailor. A person who makes me feel like this. I want to be who I am when I'm with him. \n A Charm of Finches, the second book of the Venery series, releases on November 1st and is available here: \n Kindle | \n Print | \n iTunes | \n Nook | \n Kobo | \n Smashwords",

    "review_text": "Love the Reapers books so I was excited to read this when it released as part of the 1001 Dark Nights series. Joanna Wylde's writing is smart, funny and sexy. I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when he's sure she's in it all the way. Mandy's had her eye on Shade but didn't make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser. \n \"When I first met Rebel, I'd teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn't stop talking about the man. Then I'd met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn't have to work at it. He just was big and bad.\" \n Joanna Wylde's MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can't resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper's MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time. \n \"He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we'd make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we'd probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don't even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel's ass and you know it!\" \n Shade is NOT looking for an \"old lady,\" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends. \n \"Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn't that guy. Never had been. Never would be.\" \n There's lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories. Loved visiting with the Reapers MC again. 'Shade's Lady' was a witty, funny, sexy and fast read. Highly recommend for all fans of MC romance. \n \"I'd never been much of a believer, but in that moment I saw Heaven and it was glorious.\"",

    "review_text": "Holy hotness, Batman! So much to love about this book!! (And some things, not so much!) But overall, Hail Mary was a deliciously naughty sports romance with some unforgettable passion between the main characters. Nicola Rendell is definitely a writer to watch and her book kept me engaged and laughing until the very end. \n This is a dirty, dirty book and LOTS of fun. Even if you don't usually read sports romance, give Hail Mary a try! You will love this very spicy and very funny story. I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults, with families, jobs, friends and very full lives. Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable. Yes, there is a touch if insta-love but it worked perfectly in this story. And the Chicago setting was fantastic. \n Hail Mary was a well-written, engaging, romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year. There, I said it. Hello, champagne bottle! *Fans self* I truly loved this book and love this author's fresh writing style. What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other (sorry, a big turn-off for me). I also found it a little unbelievable that Mary had no clue who Jimmy was, when they both lived in the same city where he was a famous football star. But, other readers didn't seem to mind so read this little gem of a story and judge for yourself! It's got plenty of heat and humor to please even the most jaded romance reader. I can't wait to see what's coming up next for this wonderful new author! \n \"Yeah? You think so? You think you can handle me?\" \n Her eyes widen a little. \"I think so,\" she whispers. \n Then I let her slip from my arms, such a fucking shame, but I'm not about to let her open her own door. As she gets into the cab--on the street side, the safe side--I say into her ear, \"We'll just see about that.\"",

    "review_text": "This debut by Andrea Dunlop is a fascinating tale of friendship, first love and nostalgia. The three main protagonists - Brooke, Sophie and Alex - are all compelling and complex characters. We first meet the narrator Brooke when she runs into someone from her past. Alex is now a well-known photographer and he played a pivotal role in Brooke's life when she was in college studying abroad in France. \n Not quite fluent in French, Brooke finds herself struggling with the language when she first arrives. I loved how the author explored the tole that language plays in our grasp and understanding of the world around us. \n \"Je t'aime, darling, 'I like you, I love you.' What's the difference? Imagine not needing different words for love and like, half the girls I knew practically lived and died by the nuance.\" \n The beautiful and gifted Sophie, another American student, befriends Brooke and they become very close. Brooke cannot understand what Sophie sees in her but Sophie is not quite the perfect, gifted student athlete that everyone assumes her to be. Both girls see their time in France as a way to break free of the confines of their lives back home in America. \n They become fast friends with Veronique and soon, her sexy cousin Alex, a photographer. Their family, while very glamorous, is also very dysfunctional. The dynamics are fascinating and Brooke is swept off her feet by the bohemian and free-thinking Alex. He surrounds himself with gorgeous models and artists but insists that he can see beyond the superficial. Brooke feels beautiful when she is with him and with Sophie. \n \"...people see what they want to see. You will see what you want to see.\" \n Alex quite literally sweeps Brooke off her feet. His family owns homes all over France and the girls embark on a series of adventures with him and his family in Paris, Cap Ferrat and Nantes. If you have ever visited France, or just want to visit, this book will serve as a stunning travelogue to the magnificent country! I could almost hear the noises of Paris and feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun. Brooke is entranced with Alex and quickly falls under his spell. \n \"It occurred to me that men like Alex knew how to make entrances, knew how to make you wait just long enough that you found yourself in touch with the exact despair you'd feel if they were to abandon you, then they'd show up to save the day a moment later and fill you with the joy of their presence, the relief of having been rescued from their absence.\" \n This story rockets to a stunning conclusion that was both inevitable and surprising all at once. It is a very powerful tale of friendship, love and second chances. The use of French throughout the book was perfect. I'm obsessed with this book! Perfectly written. And the cover is gorgeous. Did it make me painfully nostalgic for my twenties? Yes. I feel lost without these characters! A slow-build story that I won't soon forget. \n \"But\" - Sophie bit the edge of her lip as if she could hardly contain her smile - \"it's going to be different for us. We're going to chose. We'll make our own destiny.\" \n (With thanks to the author for a review copy.)",

    "review_text": "\"Real love heals and forgives.\" \n Nicole Archer is a quirky, funny and very creative writer and this book is a wonderful addition to the 'Ad Agency' series! I was first introduced to this author with 'Road-Tripped', an eccentric, zany but very sexy and warm-hearted romantic comedy. In 'Head-Tripped' we meet another very original cast of characters who have a sweet, sweet slow build romance. \n Effie is a brilliant violinist who was a child prodigy. She spent her childhood suffering under the weight of an overbearing mother and longing for a \"normal\" life. She moves to New York City for a fresh start and to try to escape the demons of her past. She is asked to stand in for her twin sister Callie (from 'Road Tripped') at an awards show and there she meets an insanely hot guy who captures her attention. \n Elias just happens to be a world-famous rock star but Effie has led such a sheltered life that she has no idea who he is! Elias LOVES that about her. Especially when she thinks he could be a homeless guy with no job! Elias is suffering from writer's block and thinks Effie might just be the shot in the arm that his band Urban needs. \n Effie has a lot of demons in her past and she is not completely honest with Elias at first. He has one hard and fast rule about his relationships and Effie is afraid she will lose him forever if he learns the truth about her. \n \"This wasn't going to last. Bliss never lasted - it disappeared in an instant.\" \n Elias brings Effie on the band's world tour and they are a huge hit. Effie is a brilliant musician and she and Elias truly make beautiful music together. I loved these two characters - real, flawed, imperfect and very quirky. Both of them are searching for real, honest love. Would they both be able to overcome their past demons and the people who would stop at nothing to break then apart? \n I LOVE how the author puts quotes at the beginning of each chapter, along with a fantastic playlist of songs that fit each chapter perfectly! Reading this book was a pure delight. It almost read like a travelogue at times as the band Urban travels all over the world to exotic locales on their concert tour. Effie truly is someone you would want as a best friend. This book is funny, sexxxxy, warm-hearted and very, very clever. Another win for Nicole Archer! \n \"If you love someone, you must love all of them. Even the dark parts - the craters of the moon.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.",

    "review_text": "3.5 STARS \n Another sexy, modern contemporary romance from Katy Evans! Very enjoyable with a very relatable heroine. And Callan!! WOW!! \n A very fast-paced and super-sexy story, 'Womanizer' takes place in Chicago and follows Olivia, a young intern at a hugely successful company owned by Callan Carmichael. Part of the Manwhore series, this book can absolutely stand on its own but favorite characters from the earlier books do make appearances here. Olivia is starting a new internship at Carma, Inc. and is determined to make a name for herself at the company. Even though her brother Tahoe helped her get the job, she is very driven and wants to make a great impression. \n Callan and Olivia fall for each other very quickly, and even though they both know their relationship can't really go anywhere because of the nature of their working relationship, they feel an undeniable connection. Their dialogue and flirting is sexy and fun and Olivia doesn't expect them to last beyond the length of her summer internship. \n Lots of readers will love 'Womanizer' for the main characters' chemistry, the settings and the feisty heroine. I enjoyed it as light and steamy story. If you are looking for a quick and upbeat romance with a super-hot hero, I would recommend this book. I loved the Chicago setting and smart heroine. The Epilogue was absolutely fantastic! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "3.5 Stars!! \n Con Man is a perfectly romantic, slightly raunchy, very sweet comedy from one of my favorite authors. First, let's discuss what I loved. The cover is fantastic. The premise of the story is very clever, reminiscent of the movie 'Hitch' with Will Smith. Luke is an image consultant and works with his clients to make them more confident. T. Torrest writes a fantastic male POV and the book is very funny. \n I loved Mia and could see that Luke should get her out of the \"friend zone\" almost from the very beginning - passionate, smart, funny, she is just a gorgeous woman. And she's curvy! Loved that. Their banter is very witty. \n This is a fast read but I can't say that the characters will stay with me. I did love the tie-in to the 'Remember When' series (but you do NOT need to read that series first, this book is a complete standalone). There is a major twist to this book that I did not see coming but seemed a little confusing. \n Overall, pick this one up if you're in the mood for a clever and sexy book written from a male POV. It's nothing too heavy and is an enjoyable read. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "\"Sometimes you come across a rainbow story--one that spans your heart. You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it, but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought.\" \n What a beautiful journey! 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa. Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters. \n \"I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen.\" \n The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book - harsh, stunning and dangerous. The descriptions of the land, its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical. I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears. Don't miss it!! \n \"My greatest loss had led to my greatest love. Hearts were broken, and hearts were healed. Lives were lost, and lives were saved.\"",

    "review_text": "5 STARS!! \n An intelligent, twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night! I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. \n \"I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?\" \n But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. \n \"I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.\" \n Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really \"knew\" him at all. \n \"Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.\" \n But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! \n 'The Vanishing Year' has been called a \"domestic thriller\". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti. \n Favorite quote: \n \"It wasn't that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here's your dinner. Now, it crawls under my skin and festers there, like a chigger, and the whole thing makes me itch.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars! \n \"I'm good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You'll see.\" \n In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. \n But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the \"real\" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? \n \"Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt.\" \n I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries! \n \"You can't live your life acting for other people. Other people will just use you up. You have to know yourself and figure out what you want. I can't do that for you. Nobody can.\" \n (With thanks to Atria Books for the ARC.)",

    "review_text": "The Starcrossed Anthology is sugar and spice and everything nice! Sexy, romantic and funny, Leisa Raven does the holidays right with this delightful anthology filled with some of my all-time favorite characters. I am a HUGE fan of the Starcrossed series so I was thrilled to get my hands on this juicy bundle of stories about the gang from The Grove! BAD ROMEO, BROKEN JULIET and WICKED HEART are among my top favorite stories and this anthology reminded me why I love this author's writing so much. There's a little drama, TONS of steam and hilarious laugh-out-loud moments! \n 'Have Yourself a Sexy Little Christmas' is Ethan and Cassie's story. They are newly engaged and more in love than ever. The dialogue is snappy and the story is perfect. Reading this, I remembered how much I adore Ethan Holt! \n \"His intensity takes my breath away.\" \n The appearance of Ethan's old girlfriend stirs up unwelcome feelings of insecurity and jealousy in Cassie. Of all the stories, I was unsure of where the author was going with my favorite Star-crossed couple but their holiday story was perfect! \n \"And judging from Ethan's dark determination, he aims to put everything with Vanessa firmly in the rearview mirror and reclaim me in the most primal way possible. Prove to me that as far as he's concerned, no other woman exists.\" \n SWOON! Part Two: The Naughty List is Liam and Elissa's story. He planned the perfect secret getaway but things go terribly wrong when the paparazzi make an appearance. It isn't easy being in love with a famous movie star but Lissa's man will do anything to prove that she's his one and only. Part Three: Happy Horny New Year is hilarious! Josh and Angel are perfect together and his POV provided some comic relief to this sweet and sexy anthology. If you are looking for a steamy and very romantic holiday romance, then the Star-crossed Anthology is perfect for you! Happy reading! \n \"First love. Last Love. And every love in between. That's what we are to each other. Now and forever.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "This yummy \"adult\" coloring book does not really fit into in of the traditional categories here on Goodreads but it is a must-have for any romance reader! It is a huge, gorgeous and very imaginative coloring book filled with \"doodles\" from many of my favorite contemporary romance and young adult books. I was afraid to begin coloring them in at first, but then I grabbed a bag of colored pencils and dove right in! It was actually incredibly relaxing. \n There are 45 hand-drawn illustrations inspired by books from Anna Todd, Jodi-Ellen Malpas, Colleen Hoover, RK Lilley, Tarryn Fisher, Abbi Glines, K. Bromberg, Amy Harmon, Leisa Raven, Madeline Sheehan and MORE!! \n This coloring book would make a PERFECT holiday gift for any book lover on your gift list. As a massive fan of Doodles by Christina, I am thrilled to be able to have this beautiful coloring book on my bookshelf. \n (Copy provided by the publisher with thanks.)",

    "review_text": "Filled with biting wit and sharp observation, 'Evelyn, After' tells the story of one woman's struggle to come to terms with her once picture-perfect life. Alternating before and after a tragic accident, this book poses complex questions which are not always easily answered. \n As I read this compelling story, I found myself asking, \"What would I do if this happened to me?\" At first, I thought the answer was clear. But as Evelyn's journey reveals, we don't always do what's right. People can be selfish and self-centered. The world can sometimes be a gray place. \n Evelyn is the perfect wife and mother, devoted to her distant husband and her busy teenage son. But she has hidden her real self away for years, trying to be everything to everyone. She tries to please everyone but doesn't even realize it. The author has a very keen eye for suburban life: \n \"Her real purse was shoved under the passenger seat, stuffed full of receipts and Kleenex and hand sanitizer and Band-Aids and cough drops and an emergency flashlight and anything else that any person in the world might need from her while she was near. An eternal diaper bag for the eternal mother.\" \n Of course this is a thriller and not everything is at it seems on the surface. Evelyn flip-flops between acting on what she has witnessed and letting everything go back to way it was \"before.\" \n Evelyn had been so sure just a few minutes ago. Gary had to turn this woman in. He had to tell the truth. It was the only way to put this behind them and start over. Now she didn't know anything. \n Even though Evelyn does not behave in the most admirable way in the beginning of this story, I felt strongly sympathetic towards her and I found myself saying \"Yes! YES!\" to her during the course of this very readable book. Yes, there is cheating in this story, so if that is a hard limit for you, look away! But that theme was an integral part of this book and vital to Evelyn's growth. \n She'd spent her whole life doing the right thing. That could be someone else's job now. She was moving on. \n I could not put this book down! The synopsis intrigued me. And I loved the complete metamorphosis that Evelyn experienced. This book was at times tragic, funny, sexy and sarcastic. The author's musings on marriage were sharp and unwavering \n Jesus, how had she become this? Her life had been deep and rich and complex once. She'd lived with her single mother and her older sister, and they'd been strong, resilient, quick. She'd taken city buses and negotiated dangerous neighborhoods even as a child, and she'd imagined herself growing into an artist with wild, creative friends who had little money but so much heart. \n This was real page-turner, a mature story with mature themes and situations. I loved it!! The conclusion surprised me and was perfectly satisfying. Highly recommend! \n From now on, if something was important to her, she would demand it. Because the truth was that she belonged anywhere she wanted to be, and she was beautiful just for being brave.",

    "review_text": "I've been on a thriller kick lately so this easy read fit the bill. 'When All the Girls Have Gone' is intelligent, fast-paced and very creative. Max and Charlotte are very real and relatable characters. Loved the author's smart and snappy writing style! The romance felt completely honest, down-to-earth and very \"true\". \n Jayne Ann Krentz is a new author to me so I very much enjoyed getting to know her writing style. She has legions of fans and I can see why. I adored Max, who is a man of few words but knows how to get the job done. He has a very painful past so his lovely romance with Charlotte seems all the more sweeter. Charlotte is a no-nonsense heroine, who finds herself working in a retirement home after making some big life changes. \n Charlotte's step-sister Jocelyn is traveling to a retreat. The two sisters are very close but Jocelyn has protected and sheltered Charlotte all of their lives. A mysterious package arrives at Jocelyn's home while she is away and Charlotte learns that Jocelyn's best friend Louise has died. Jocelyn is unreachable, since she is on a \"no technology\" retreat. \n Enter Max Cutler, who was already involved in the matter after being hired by a cousin of Louise's. Is Louise's sudden death related to Jocelyn's disappearance? The details begin to unfold in this delicious thriller. There are lots of shady characters and plenty of secrets. This is a quick, super-intriguing and twisty story that you can read in one day. I absolutely loved Max Cutler, with his smart, strong, quiet ways. He is my kind of hero! The romance is a quiet one but it fits perfectly with this story. There is tons of action and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading this book. \n Jayne Ann Krantz is a skilled writer and Max and Charlotte's story grabbed me from the very first page. There are lots of surprises in this one with some humor thrown in for good measure. Charlotte and Max are a little awkward, very lonely and absolutely perfect together! If you love a good mystery with a little romance and a smart and \"spunky\" heroine, then you'll love 'When All the Girls Have Gone.' There are several characters' POV's in this book which kept me on my toes. All in all, an enjoyable, solid thriller with just the right amount of romance and danger! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "This book is a very engaging and emotional story that centers around Kathleen and Jack, co-workers who are romantically involved. The story starts off with a bang and launches right into the lives of these two and their families. If you are a fan of more mature romances, then this book is for you! Jack is a single dad, whose ex-wife moved across the country after their divorce. Kathleen works in her family's company along with Jack, and has some serious emotional baggage. \n The author drew me right in with her flowing, easy writing style. A very talented writer, Ms. Locklear has created some very engaging and very \"real\" characters. No one is a billionaire, and these people have very messy and untidy personal lives. Just like real life! Jack and Kathleen's story is not all wrapped up neatly with a bow and I liked that, because real life is often messy and unpredictable. \n There are some steamy romance scenes in this book but for the most part it is more like women's fiction. I really felt for these characters, and was very surprised at the turn this book took at the end. There are no cliches in this book and I loved how Kathleen acted when a very serious incident occurs near the end of this book. I also loved how the author did not portray Jack's ex-wife as totally villainous. I would like to know why she left her young daughter behind when she moved away after her divorce from Jack. \n 'Constellation' is a very passionate and heartwarming book that brings out lots of emotion. This story ends on a cliffhanger but I must find out what happens next! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)",

He runs the beast through with a sword and then retraces his steps using the string, thus saving all the sacrifices that year and in the future. I've reached the center of the maze. I'm facing my very own Minotaur. \n Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Her books never fail to enthrall, entertain and excite. 'The Pawn' is trademark Skye Warren: a sheltered, innocent young woman, smart but faced with almost insurmountable odds against her, and a dark hero, who seems unbearably cruel but who might just have a soft side. \n Avery's whole world has collapsed and she faces loses her family's home. Her father is dying and she has nowhere to turn. She agrees to an auction, which goes against everything she believes in. Enter Gabriel Miller, dangerous, handsome and ruthless. Even though he was the cause of her family's downfall, can he possibly be her savior? \n He steps back with a quiet laugh. \"You can run away, little virgin. But you'll come back.\" I'm very afraid he's right. \n Avery is afraid to trust Gabriel but she has nowhere else to turn. Gabriel turns out to be sensual and protective but even more mysterious than Avery first thought. He is her father's enemy but he can't stay away from Avery. \n \"What am I then?\" \n \"You're innocent. And I'm going to ruin you.\" \n The certainty in his voice chills me. \n I devoured this dark and sexy book in one sitting. Skye Warren is the BEST at writing uber-sexy, controlling men and Gabriel Miller is one I won't forget! 'The Pawn' is a fast-paced tale of revenge and control, perfect for lovers of dark romance. Avery and Gabriel are perfect together and I was thrilled to have the second book to start immediately after finishing! \n You can have my body, I think. But you can't touch my heart. \n Favorite quote: \n \"I'm acting like a man who got what he paid for. Excellent service. Would you like a review on Yelp? Five stars.\"",

This story is a pure fairytale, down to the names of some of the characters to the plot. Poor Nicholas has followed the rules his whole life. And now it is time for to select a wife, but only because his grandmother the Queen is forcing him to finally settle down. He can't bear the thought of it and takes off for the United States for one last \"fling\". \n \"If you were told that the world as you knew it--life as you knew it--would end in five months, what would you do? You'd make the most of the time you had left, of course. Do everything you wanted to do--everyone you wanted to do--for as long as you could. Until time was up. Well...looks like I've got a plan, after all.\" \n Olivia is hard-working \"commoner\" who runs her family business in New York. She is having a tough time keeping the struggling diner going. Nicholas happens to stumble into the diner after a wild night of partying and is stunned by the beautiful Olivia. \n If Helen launched a thousand ships, this girl could raise a thousand hard-ons. \n Of course, their relationship is NOT supposed to happen! He can't possibly fall in love with a commoner! So they agree to a brief summer fling. Olivia is not easily impressed, but even she realizes that they both live in very different worlds. \n ...I grab his arm, shaking. \"I don't think you understand--you live in a freaking castle!\" \n \"Technically, it's a palace. Castles were built for defense, palaces more for the monarch to hold court in appropriate grandeur.\" \n And Jesus, I want to stick my tongue down his throat. \"Have I told you how hot it is when you roll out the royal facts?\" \n 'Royally Screwed' is a very charming fairytale with a healthy does of Emma Chase's trademark spicy humor. All of the characters also seem very down-to-earth with many of the same problems and heartaches as everyone else. \n Nicholas knows he lives in an insulated world and he does his best to keep Olivia safe. But wicked characters are lurking everywhere, in the form of the paparazzi, jealous old girlfriends and even the Queen herself. Their relationship seems doomed from the start. \n \"It not easy being my friend; it's even more difficult being my lover. Think of me as a walking exploding bomb--anything near to me will eventually become collateral damage.\" \n What I enjoyed about this book was the witty, sexy, fast-paced dialogue and the engaging supporting characters. There's also a wonderful theme of family and duty running through this story that I really loved. \n The author has created a very relatable fairytale that provided an escape from real life. The ending was a lovely surprise and along with Nicholas and Olivia, I adored his brother Henry. I can't wait to read his story! \n \"She looks into my eyes and I'm lost. Wrecked. Owned. There's no thought, no desire--except to please her. Make her see stars and touch heaven.\"",

    "review_text": "Yes, you can have your wine and still lose weight! As a vegetarian for many years, I was excited to read this witty but very informative book that seemed right up my alley. If you have been looking for an easy, very down-to-earth way to eat healthier and maybe lose some weight in the process, then this book is a must-read. Filled with THE yummiest, easiest recipes, 'WTF Am I Supposed to Eat?' offers a common-sense, practical approach to a more delicious and healthier way of life. \n I hate to use the word \"diet\" but trust me, you will definitely lose weight by following even just a few of the fantastic tips in this book. I have followed a modified version of the food plans in this book for most of my adult life and have maintained the same weight for many years. You don't have to be vegan or vegetarian to read this book but if you have been thinking about it, this book will give you the background and the confidence boost to try. \n I loved this book because not only does the author explain why certain foods are good for you, she gives you super-easy recipes that are quick and satisfying. I also love her philosophy that everything is okay in moderation. You love red wine? It's okay! You can still keep your wine but also eat healthy the rest of the time (although I think a glass of red wine is good for everyone!) I also appreciated the variety of foods and the philosophy that not every diet plan is perfect for everybody, \n Find what's right for you and you will be more likely to stick with it, not as a \"diet\" but as a way of life. And you will feel better, too! I am looking forward to getting this book in paperback to give as gifts and for my own kitchen. \n Grab this now for only 99 cents before release day! http://amzn.to/2hMa3GZ \n (ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",

    "review_text": "Katy Evans has created another sweet AND swoony hero! I read this hot romance between Matt and Charlotte in one siting. 'Mr. President' is a feel-good story set against the exciting backdrop of America's capitol. With the U.S. election season almost at an end, we all can use a good old-fashioned political romance! \n Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families. Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S. president. Their futures seem pre-destined. But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life, until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life. She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president, that she would join his campaign. Now fast-forward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate. \n He is very passionate about changing the world. Charlotte, who worked for her mother's organization assisting women in need, is totally captivated by him and can't hep but be mesmerized by him. This is a political campaign so Matt's every move is being watched. Charlotte is a campaign staffer. Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance? \n I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics. Ms. Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows. Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together, even though this story was a slow-burn romance. It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon, in January 2017. I can't wait to see how Matt and Charlotte's romance plays out. \n \"We're a perfect couple, in the most imperfect situation.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",
